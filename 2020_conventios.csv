Democratic,4,Tom Perez,1,04:01,"Hi, I’m Tom Perez. This has been an incredible week. It hasn’t been the kind of convention you might’ve been expecting, and to be honest, it wasn’t the kind of convention we had planned for, but in a way, what we’ve seen over the last three nights, and what we’ll see tonight is a more accurate reflection of where our country is than any traditional convention could have been. Yes, we’ve talked a lot about our next President and Vice President, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We’ve talked about how they’ll tackle the challenges we face and lead our country to a brighter future. And we’ve seen that our party is ready to lead, not just now, but into the next generation. But we’ve also heard a lot from people who aren’t running for anything this year, people who might not even think of themselves as political, auto workers and college students, farmers, and immigrants, teachers, nurses, and yes, the occasional calamari chef.",163,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Tom Perez,2,04:58,"If the literal meaning of the word convention has to do with coming together, then what is brought us together this year isn’t partisanship, it’s purpose. That’s what has allowed us to bring both diehard progressive’s and conservative ex Republicans under the same tent. That’s what has allowed us to build a campaign where no State, no precinct, no vote is taken for granted. That’s how we build our movement. That’s how we went up and down the ballot. That’s how we make change. And when we can bring that kind of energy to the challenges, our nation faces, well, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. Just ask Joe Biden, who set his sights on a mission that could change the world forever conquering cancer.

Democratic,4,Joe Biden,3,06:51,"I think of all the people who have gone through what I’ve gone through without one tenth of the help that I’ve had. When you have a son or daughter, husband or wife, someone you adore, you become as educated as you can, as quickly as you can, particularly when you know that’s a very serious form. I learned a lot about the mechanics of cancer and the delivery systems, and there’s so many changes that are just on the cusp. I have now met with over 200 oncologists and cancer research centers, and I’m asking them, ” What is it you want me to clear the way for? Where are we in impediment?” Speaker 14: ( 07:24 )  He is determined.

Democratic,4,Joe Biden,6,08:14,"I believe in Moonshot in this country to cure cancer. It’s personal, but I know we can do this. There are so many breakthroughs just on the horizon. We can make real with an absolute national commitment. There are Democrats and Republicans on the Hill who share our passion to silence this deadly disease. If I could be anything, I would want to be the President of ended cancer, because it’s possible.",72,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Amanda Litman,1,08:51,"I’m Amanda Littman. I’m the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Run For Something. In May, 2017, I was invited to join a small meeting in D.C. with a handful of other organization leaders to give updates to the VP on our work. The VP came over, and I tried to play a cool, “Well, my Grammy would be furious if she knew I was at a meeting with you and didn’t get a photo.” “Grammy?” The VP said, perking up as we pose for the photo, you can see here. “Let’s call her.” I called her. “Someone wants to talk to you.” “Hi Grammy, this is Joe Biden.” She was overwhelmed. Grammy went on to tell him her second eldest, my aunt Michelle was in the hospital, colon cancer, advanced, that she was really sick. The VP’s posture changed immediately. “I’m so sorry, Grammy. I’m so, so sorry. You know, my son Beau died of cancer. As a parent, you should never have to even think of one day burying a child. It’s a nightmare.” Amanda Litman: ( 09:45 )  He stepped away speaking personally with her about sitting in a hospital room with a sick child, about pain. I could hear her choking up on the phone. “I’m giving Amanda my personal home phone number. You need anything, you call me. I’ll come to the hospital and sit with you. Anything.” Grammy still talks about that call. “He’s a genuinely nice man,” she says. “He just gets it.” Her grief, and my family’s grief mattered to him. Our entire country is grieving. We are all going through trauma. Our next president needs to be the one helping us heal. That’s why I’m glad and excited to vote this fall, not just against Trump, but genuinely for Joe Biden.",299,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Tom Perez,3,10:25,"Before we continue with tonight’s program, I want to thank everyone who has made this unprecedented convention possible from our delegates and speakers to our party staff and our production team. Next week, it will be the Republican Party’s turn to hold their convention. On behalf of their speakers and staff, I hope their organizers will take safety as seriously as we have. And then it will be up to you, America, you’ll have heard from two very different candidates for President. You’ll be able to dig into the details of their respective plans for solving the challenges we face, and decide which plan you think will work for you and your family.",113,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Tom Perez,4,11:08,"But the choice this year is deeper than that. No matter what you think about Donald Trump or Joe Biden, no matter which party you belong to, or whether you belong to any party at all, your job in this election is to decide what kind of movement is capable of being the vehicle for the change we need. Can a movement that demands absolute loyalty to one man and his personal agenda really ever make this country greater? Or do we do better when we join together in a movement of shared values, one that amplifies our diverse voices. We’ve got one more night to show America what our path forward looks like. Not one man, boasting that he alone can fix it, but every day people coming together to face our challenges with unity and determination. Now we turn to one example, California’s fight against the dangerous wildfires raging throughout the State. Please welcome Governor Gavin Newsom.",159,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Governor Gavin Newsom,1,12:11,"Well, I confess this is not where I expected to be speaking here tonight. I’m about a mile or so away from one of over 370 wildfires that we’re battling here in the State of California. We are just coming off a record week, a heat wave that led to 130 degree temperatures, the highest temperature ever recorded in California, arguably the world’s history here in our State. The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier. Climate change is real. If you are in denial about climate change, come to California. 11,000 dry lightening strikes, we had over a 72 hour period, leading to this unprecedented challenge with these wildfires.",112,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Governor Gavin Newsom,2,12:51,"This is an extraordinary moment in our history. Mother nature has now joined this conversation around climate change. And so we too need to advance that conversation a new. Just today, the President of United States threatened the State of California, 40 million Americans, that happen to live here in the State of California to defund our efforts on wildfire suppression, because he said we hadn’t raked enough leaves. He can’t make that up, nor can he make up the fact we’re involved in over 90 lawsuits with the Trump administration on clean air, on clean water, on endangered species, on pesticides. There is so much at stake in this election, none more important than the work Joe Biden did with Barack Obama on the vehicle emissions standards, the fuel efficiency standards. It will save billions and billions of dollars taxpayers, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. There is so much at stake in this election.",156,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Governor Gavin Newsom,3,13:47,"I couldn’t help myself on my way to one of our relief centers, one of our evacuation centers, just to jump out of the car and just express my deep reverence, my admiration to Joe Biden, to Kamala Harris, California’s own, to their faith, their devotion, their constancy, to their commitment, and not just to the environment, but to the Commonwealth, to our kids, our kids’ kids, our grandkids, to our legacy. There is so much at stake in this election. And I just want to close by reminding each and every one of you. The future is not just something to experience, it’s something to manifest. It’s inside of us, not just in front of us. It’s our decision, not our conditions that will determine our fate and future. So let us resolve that after this historic night, this incredible, incredible week, this remarkable convention, that we do everything in our power to get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in to the White House in January, 2021.",168,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Democratic,4,Joe Biden,7,15:06,"America’s an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful dictator or tyrant. It gives hope. In this nation, we believe in honesty, decency, treating everyone with respect, giving anyone a fair shot, living nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor, leading by the power of our example, not by the example of our power, that’s allowed us to stand as a beacon to the world, being part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s a code. It’s a uniquely American code, the most powerful idea in the history of the world. The American Creed that we’re all created equal I think beats in the heart of people in this country.",115,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt

Democratic,4,Andrew Yang,2,19:28,"Hello America, I’m Andrew Yang. You might know me as the guy who ran for President talking about math in the future. Unfortunately for all of us, that future is now. The pandemic has accelerated everything. If you’re like me and my wife, Evelyn, you don’t know if your child’s school is going to reopen this fall. 72% of Americans believe that this is the worst time we have ever experienced.

I played the Vice President and he was in fact, the Vice President, and we hit it off immediately. Soon after I was asked to be on the cover of a magazine. Remember those? And I was so excited.

To be a commander, you must always put your troops first, because one day you may order them to sacrifice everything for our great nation to do that, leaders must command their troops respect and be worthy of their pledge to protect and defend our constitution. No matter the cost, but military service, doesn’t just take sacrifice from those in uniform. It’s required from their families too. My husband Brian was the one who rushed to Walter Reed. After I was wounded in Iraq, he was the one holding my hand, waiting for me to wake up.",157,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt

Our military spouses hold their families together, praying for their loved ones safety, wherever they’re deployed and serving as caregivers to our disabled service members. And then picking up the pieces and starting again, whenever the next tour or the next war arises, Joe Biden understands the sacrifices because he’s made them himself. When his son Beau deployed to Iraq, his burden was also shouldered by his family. Joe knows the fear military families live because he’s felt that dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe. He understands their bravery because he has had to muster that same strength. Every hour of every day Beau was overseas.

When you put your life on the line for this country, you do it, not because it’s the country you live in, but because it’s a country you believe in. I believe in this country, because America uniquely holds the promise of a place where everyone can belong. We know that for too many, and for too long, that promise has been denied. But we also know America is at its best when we make that circle of belonging wider. Just over 10 years ago, I joined a military where firing me because of who I am wasn’t just possible, it was policy. Now, in 2020, it is unlawful in America to fire someone because of who they are, or who they love. The very ring on my finger, a wedding we celebrated, here where I’m standing, reflects how this country can change.

At the time I said, we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation and we are. One of the most important conversations I’ve had this entire campaign. It was with someone who was much too young to vote. I met with six year old Giana Floyd, the day before her daddy, George Floyd was laid rest. She’s an incredibly brave little girl, and I’ll never forget it. When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and she said, “Daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Joe Biden: ( 02:24:12 )  Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd murder was a breaking point. Maybe John Lewis is passing the inspiration, but however it’s come to be, however it’s happened, America’s ready in John’s words to lay down, “The heavy burden of hate at last.” And then the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism.",181,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-democratic-national-convention-dnc-night-4-transcript.txt

Democratic,4,Joe Biden,50,02:25:07,"Many people have heard me say this, but I’ve always believed you can define America in one word, possibilities.

A united America, United in our pursuit of a more perfect union, United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are you ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. We’re a good and decent people.

Democratic,4,Joe Biden,52,02:26:17,"The Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote, “History says don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then once in a lifetime the long for tidal wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.” This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme with passion and purpose. Let us begin you and I together. One nation under God, united in our love for American, united in our love for each other, for love is more powerful than hate. Hope is more powerful than fear, and right is more powerful and dark. This is our moment. This is our mission. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we’ll do it together. I promise you. Thank you. And may God bless you.

Four years ago, we faced a historic crossroad. Career politicians promising change every election, but delivering emptiness. We chose a different path, a man who is not a politician, a man who cares, a man who loves America and all Americans. A man who works tirelessly for you, even tonight during this nomination.

We are America, despite unpredictable events, we as Americans work together to overcome challenges, write our own stories.

Republican,1,Charlie Kirk,1,33:32,"Good evening. It is an honor to be with you tonight. My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our republic. Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. I am here tonight to tell you, to warn you, that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love. For decades, ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists. They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life. All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country. We may not have realized it at the time, but Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization. Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob – Charlie Kirk: ( 35:03 )  … was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life. Our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values. President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life. The American way of life means you follow the law. You work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values and you work to create a civil society. The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion and that church is more essential than a casino. And it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics. The American way of life is being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful, activists who have never built anything in their lives. They have us locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison.",392,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Charlie Kirk,2,36:07,"We are kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state funded propaganda on major tech platforms. This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the Union from disintegration. This election is not just the most important of our lifetime. It is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865. By re-electing Trump, we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them. We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities. We’ll be a country that rises to higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible. A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful not angry that we live in the United States.",155,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Charlie Kirk,3,37:08,"We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way. We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead. We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for the defender of Western civilization, our champion, my friend, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.",95,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Rebecca Friedrichs,1,37:58,"I’m Rebecca Friedrichs, a veteran California public school educator. I’m here to give voice to America’s great teachers because our voices have been silenced for decades by unions who claim to represent us. They do not. When other dedicated teachers and I served within the unions, we spoke up in defense of children, parents, scientific fact and American values. For our trouble, we were brutalized, booed off the platform, barred from committees, shouted down and even spit upon by union leaders. This is how unions treat devoted teachers, but what’s even worse is how their agenda of control deceives Americans and our children. They’ve intentionally rewritten American history to perpetuate division, pervert the memories of our American founders and disparage our Judeo-Christian virtues. They’re lenient discipline policies morphed our schools into war zones and they back defunding police and abolishing ICE. Unions collect billions annually from unsuspecting teachers and push this radical agenda into our classrooms against our will. Why.",160,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Rebecca Friedrichs,2,39:23,"The only way to keep a free republic is with a well-educated moral citizenry that can self- govern. Unions are subverting our republic, so they undermine educational excellence, morality, law and order. That’s why they spend hundreds of millions annually to defeat charter schools and school choice. Trapping so many precious, low-income children in dangerous, corrupt, and low-performing schools. To fight back on behalf of children and America, brave teachers brought a lawsuit against unions. And do you know who intervened against us? The Obama, Biden administration and California Attorney General Kamala Harris. They argued against us at the U.S. Supreme Court. Their comrades labeled us spawns of Satan and slandered us in mainstream media. No matter their abuse, we’ll keep fighting for the country and children we love just like President Trump. He’s breaking the union’s grip on our schools. That’s why unions have tried to destroy him since the day he was elected. But President Trump isn’t afraid to fight for what’s right. He won’t back down. His courage gives great teachers renewed hope?",176,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Rebecca Friedrichs,3,40:49,"He’s even proposed education freedom scholarships to return control to parents, protect religious liberties and empower kids to escape dangerous, low-performing schools. The Republican platform supports educational freedom. The Democrat Party does not. Democrats stand with deceptive teachers unions who pick on loving teachers and little kids. President Trump stands with America’s families, great teachers, and most importantly, our children.

Republican,1,Tanya Weinreis,1,41:45,"So grateful to speak with you today. My name is Tanya Weinreis. I am from Montana where I live with my husband, my hero, a Marine and retired police officer. My husband and I own Mountain Mudd Espresso. We are not some multinational corporation. Our success is not measured by stockholders but by our neighbors, the people we see at church and at jujitsu school with our son. Mountain Mudd Espresso is the American story. A story not just for entrepreneurs but for millions of hardworking men and women who are building their American dream every day. A few months ago like so many businesses, we got the crushing news, a large event we were serving was canceled because of the virus. Our business was on the brink, threatened to be shut down from losses that were not our fault. I was scared. I thought of our 50 employees, the Mountain Mudd family.",153,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Tanya Weinreis,2,42:49,"And when I thought of their jobs, I thought of their rent being due, their kids and I felt personally responsible. I’m not too proud to admit that I fell on my knees and prayed, Lord, what do I do? His words rang clear, keep on working, it will be okay. I had faith. And let me tell you, you have to have faith when your husband is a Marine and a police officer who was shot at on the job. And when you run a business, a little faith goes a long way. Faith in Jesus and faith in America. But I’m worried we have a generation of Americans who have been told that the American dream doesn’t exist. That’s a lie. I know because I live that dream. That’s why I feel so strongly that we need a president who believes in the American dream like President Donald Trump, now more than ever.",155,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Tanya Weinreis,3,43:47,"I am so thankful that my prayers for help were answered. My company was one of the first to receive a PPP loan and praise God, it has been a lifesaver. Not only were we able to keep every single employee but we’ve been hiring weekly ever since. I feel for local businesses across America who are under assault from shutdowns, from riots, and now facing the terrifying prospect of Joe Biden coming after everything we’ve built. I am so grateful we have leaders like President Trump, standing up for local businesses like mine.

Republican,1,Matt Gaetz,1,44:48,"I’m Congressman Matt Gaetz, I’m speaking to you from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden’s daily schedule. But we are a nation of full hearts and clear minds. We see the choice clearly, strength or weakness, energy or confusion, success or failure. President Trump is the first president since Reagan not to start a new war. Biden has foolishly cheerled decades of war without winning, without end. President Trump knows we are strongest when we fight hardest, not in distant deserts, but for our fellow Americans. We must fight to save America now or we may lose her forever. Joe Biden might not even notice. Settle for Biden, that’s the hashtag promoted by AOC and the socialists. The woketopians will settle for Biden because they will make him an extra in a movie written, produced, and directed by others. It’s a horror film really. They’ll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door.",162,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Matt Gaetz,2,45:50,"And the police aren’t coming when you call in Democrat run cities, they’re already being defunded, disbanded. Blaming our best and allowing society’s worst, that’s the story they write in Hollywood. That’s if the lights even stay on in California anymore, a state that cannot keep power running for its own people should not send its junior Senator to be vice president. They used to write only in fiction, but nightmares are becoming real. Cops killed, children shot. At the Democrat convention they say, if you vote against Trump, it will all stop. Appeasement is never a winning strategy. No, we won’t settle for violence in our neighborhoods or at our border. We won’t settle for decades of bad decisions by basement dwelling Joe Biden. We settle a continent. We know that the frontier, the horizon, even the stars belonged to us. Donald Trump like all builders is a visionary. That which is built in the mind is even more powerful than the brick and mortar that holds it together.",170,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Matt Gaetz,3,46:52,"First comes the mind, then the making. First comes the vision, then the work. Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson are immortal precisely because of the pull they have on our imagination. You cannot cancel a culture that loves its heroes. The dangerous left need America to be weaker to accomplish their goal of replacing her. We know that to make America great again, we must first make something of ourselves. That is the meaning of true strength. My great-grandfather was a railroad man. As a Florida man, I watch our rockets routinely send the brightest beyond the heavens with our flag and our hope. America is the greatest country that has ever existed. Don’t let any celebrity athlete or politician tell you otherwise.",122,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Matt Gaetz,4,47:39,"President Trump sometimes raises his voice and a ruckus. He knows that’s what it takes to raise an army of patriots who love America and will protect her. We must win this election if we cherish our country as much as we should, for there is no place to run, no refuge for freedom should we fail. America is not just an idea or a constitution, it is our home. We must protect our home with unbreakable made in America strength. Strength I see every day in President Donald Trump.

Republican,1,Kim Klacik,1,48:17,"My name is Kim Klacik and I’m running for Congress in Maryland’s seventh district. And like Shirley Chisholm, I’m unbought and unbossed. Let me remind you, the Democrats have controlled this part of Baltimore City for over 50 years and they run this beautiful place right into the ground. Abandoned buildings, liquor stores on every corner, drug addicts, guns on the street, that’s now the norm in many neighborhoods. You think Maryland taxpayers would be getting a whole lot since our taxes are out of control, instead we’re paying for decades of incompetence and corruption. Sadly, the same cycle of decay exists in many of America’s Democrat run cities. And yet the Democrats still assume that black people will vote for them. No matter how much they let us down and take us for granted. We’re sick of it. We’re not going to take it anymore. The days of blindly supporting the Democrats are coming to an end.",158,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Kim Klacik,2,49:07,"In Baltimore, we had the highest number of black Republicans in the entire country running for office this election cycle. Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves, that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views. We’re not buying the lies anymore. You and your party have neglected us for far too long. We want safety in our neighborhoods. We want to make the most of the federal opportunity zone I’m standing in right now in West Baltimore. We want higher paying jobs and more business opportunities. We want lower taxes. We want school choice. We want a chance to get ahead, not just get by. That’s what President Trump promised and that’s what President Trump delivered. I want Baltimore to be an example to republicans around the country that we can compete in our inner cities if we reach out to the citizens and deliver real results.",150,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Kim Klacik,3,49:56,President Trump is bringing this country back roaring. He’s bringing the American spirit to life for all Americans.

I’m Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and on behalf of everyone in our party and President Trump, thank you for tuning in as we kick off this historic convention. As we speak to you tonight, we send our thoughts and prayers to those facing terrible fires in California, recovering from storms in Iowa, and preparing for hurricanes in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. Democrats started their convention last week with Eva Longoria, a famous Hollywood actress who played a housewife on T.V.

Republican,1,Ronna McDaniel,2,51:23,"And unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn’t choose me because I’m a woman, he chose me because I was the best person for the job. Four years ago, President Trump started a movement unlike any other. And over the next four days, we will hear from a few of the millions of hardworking everyday Americans who have benefited from his leadership. If you watched the DNC last week, you probably noticed that Democrats spent a lot of time talking about how much they despise our president. But we heard very little about their actual policies. Policies that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Policies like banning fossil fuels, eliminating private health insurance, taxpayer funded healthcare for people who come here illegally and defunding the police.",126,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Ronna McDaniel,3,52:17,"Their argument for Joe Biden boiled down to the fact that they think he’s a nice guy. Well, let me tell you, raising taxes on 82% of Americans is not nice. Eliminating 10 million good paying oil and gas jobs is not nice. Policies that force jobs to flee our country or allow abortion up until the point of birth are not nice. The truth is, there’s only one person who has empathized with everyday Americans and actually been fighting for them over the past four years and that is President Donald Trump. In the nearly four years I’ve worked on behalf of President Trump, I’ve seen up close a man who has a deep love for family. A man who has reverence for the office of the presidency. A man with an incredible respect for law enforcement and our military. I’ve seen private moments where he comforts Americans in times of pain and sadness.",155,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Tough when he fights to secure our borders. President Trump is always going to be tough when he is fighting for the American people because nice guys like Joe cared more about countries like China and Iran than the United States of America. Tonight begins a new chapter in the great American story, a story that has inspired the world for generations. And when we re-elect President Trump this November, the best is yet to come. This election is the most important in our lifetime. Your vote counts more than ever. If you want to check your voting status, secure your ballot, or register to vote, text vote to 8-8-0-2-2.

Even though I was the youngest of four children, I was always somewhat of a caretaker. It came natural for me. So it felt right to follow in my mother’s footsteps and become a nurse. And this March, when COVID-19 send our country into crisis, I knew I had to help any way that I could. I deployed to New York in April and then to San Antonio, Texas working as a COVID relief nurse in both states. As I continued with the challenges of treating our patients who had their worlds turned upside down, I noticed a positive change in our healthcare system.

This left our most vulnerable populations with no other choice but to have an in-person office visit with their physicians, increasing their risk of exposure to COVID-19 exponentially. The expansion of tele-health services has also resulted in the integration of video visits between patients and their families. Allowing loved ones to have contact and visualization, as well as a better understanding of care. Tele-health has been essential during this pandemic. I don’t want the media taking my personal story and twisting it, so let me be clear.

I know this as a health professional and as someone who has recovered from COVID himself. The COVID-19 pandemic exploded into our great nation with an intensity unparalleled in history.

A prompt response led by President Trump cleared away the red tape that usually makes drug approvals a long and drawn out process.

Let me give you three clear examples of how President Trump’s leadership removed regulatory barriers so COVID patients could have faster access to effective therapies and diagnostics. First on February 26, two phase three clinical trials studying remdesivir were initiated. Just two months later, the FDA approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat COVID-19. Normally this is a three to five year process. The amazing speed with which this happened in a safe but efficient manner is unheard of. Second, the FDA granted expanded access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Within 24 hours of this approval, we were administering convalescent plasma and remdesivir to a critically ill patient, a former Army ranger and physician.

Within 15 minutes, my test came back positive and within four hours I was receiving my remdesivir doses followed by an infusion of convalescent plasma. As a physician, I’ve seen firsthand how these breakthroughs have saved countless lives. As a patient I’ve benefited from the expedited therapies made by the swift action of this administration. President Trump truly moved mountains to save lives and he deserves credit. Thank you President Trump for providing timely access to critical diagnostics and therapeutics during this pandemic.

Our family has seen it. Two years ago, our nephew Eli was killed in a car accident. He lived a mile up the road from us, grew up wrestling and training with our boys, was a high school state champion, varsity athlete for the University of Wisconsin. It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident, I walked to the car to head up to Eli’s parents’ home when the president called. We talked about a few issues and then he asked how the family was doing. I said, “They’re doing okay, Mr. President, but it’s tough.” The president said, “Yeah, losing a loved one is always difficult. It’s really tough when they’re so young.” Congressman Jim Jordan: ( 01:15:44 )  I then said, “Mr. President, I’m actually walking into their house right now. Obviously they don’t know that I’m talking to you, but if you’d be willing to say hello to Eli’s dad, you’d make a terrible day a little less terrible.” “What’s his name?” the president asked. I walked through the door and said, “Todd, the president wants to talk to you.” For the next five minutes, family and friends sat in complete silence as the president of the United States took time to talk to a dad who was hurting. That’s the president I’ve gotten to know the last four years. The president who shared private moments like this with soldiers, victims of violent crime and people who’ve had businesses destroyed by the mob. That’s the individual who’s made America great again and who knows America’s best days are still in front of us. That’s why I’m busting my tail to help him get reelected.

So, why don’t they forego their security and replaced them with social workers, especially since that’s what they want for you and me. Our police need more funding, not less for frequent psychological examinations, for non-lethal remote restraint technology and for more deescalation and use of force training.

Every red flag you could imagine, but the school didn’t just miss these red flags, they knowingly ignored them. Far left Democrats in our school district made this shooting possible because they implemented something they called restorative justice. This policy, which really just blames teachers for student’s failures puts kids and teachers at risk and make shootings more likely, but it was built as a pioneering approach to discipline and safety.

It divides freedom from fear, it divides the past from the future. I know all about the past. I’ll never forget my own. My family has fled totalitarianism and communism more than once. First, my dad from Spain and then from Cuba, but my family’s don’t run away. By the grace of God, I live the American dream, the greatest blessing I ever had. My dad only had a sixth grade education told me, “Don’t lose this place. You will never be as lucky as me.” Maximo Alvarez: ( 02:07:14 )  I’m speaking to you today because my family’s done abandoning what we rightfully earned. There’s no place to hide. I’m speaking to you today because President Trump may not always be politically correct. He is, in fact, a successful businessman, not your average career politician. Our president is just another family man, a friend, and most important, our elected commander in chief who puts America first. Keep in mind, the other guy running for president is mostly concerned about power. Yes, yes.

I heard the promises of Fidel Castro and I can never forget all those who grew up around me who look like me, who suffer and starved and died because they believed those empty promises. They swallow the communist poison pill. If you have a chance, go the Freedom Tower in Miami, stop and listen. You can still hear the sounds of those broken promises.

They sound familiar. When Fidel Castro was asked if he was a communist, he said he was a Roman Catholic. He knew he had to hide the truth. But the country I was born in is gone, totally destroyed.

Republican,1,Nikki Haley,1,02:14:28,"Good evening. I’m Nikki Haley, and it’s great to be back at the Republican National Convention. I’ll start with a little story. It’s about an American ambassador to the United Nations and it’s a speech she gave to this convention. She called for the reelection of the Republican president she served and she called out his democratic opponent, a former vice president from a failed administration. That ambassador said, and I quote, ” Democrats always blame America first.” The year was 1984. The president was Ronald Reagan and ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick’s words are just as true today. Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first and he has earned four more years as president. It was an honor of a lifetime to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now the UN is not for the faint of heart. It’s a place where dictators, murderers and thieves denounce America, and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills. Well, President Trump put an end to all of that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America and we stood against our enemies. Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history. Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash.

Republican,1,Nikki Haley,2,02:16:29,"Obama and Biden led the United nations to denounce our friend and ally Israel. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and when the UN tried to condemn us, I was proud to cast the American veto. This president has a record of strength and success. The former vice president has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for communist China, and he’s a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain and abandon our values. Donald Trump takes a different approach.

When Joe was VP, I was governor of the great state of South Carolina. We had a pretty good run. Manufacturers of all kinds flocked to our state from overseas, creating tens of thousands of American jobs. People were referring to South Carolina as the beast of the Southeast, which I loved. Everything we did happened in spite of Joe Biden and his old boss. We cut taxes, they raised them. We slashed red tape, they piled on more mandates.

They want to ban fracking and kill millions of jobs. They want massive tax hikes on working families. Joe Biden, and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy, but President Trump is leading a new era of opportunity.

America is a story that’s a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone. That’s why it’s so tragic to see so much of the democratic party turning a blind eye towards riots and rage. The American people know we can do better. And of course we value and respect every black life. The black cops who’ve been shot in the line of duty, they matter. The black small business owners who’ve watched their life’s work go up and flames, they matter.

After that horrific tragedy, we didn’t turn against each other. We came together, black and white, Democrat and Republican, together we made the hard choices needed to heal and removed a divisive symbol peacefully and respectfully. What happened then should give us hope now. America isn’t perfect, but the principles we hold dear are perfect.

Where every girl and boy, every woman and man of every race and religion has the best shot at the best life. In this election, we must choose the only candidate who has and who will continue delivering on that vision. President Trump and vice president Pence have my support and America has our promise. We will build on the progress of our past and unlock the promise of our future. That future starts when the American people reelect president Donald Trump. Thank you, goodnight and may God always bless America. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:24:04 )  Good evening America. I’m Donald Trump Jr. We’re here tonight to talk about the great American story, to talk about this country we all love, this land of promise and opportunity, of heroes and greatness. Just a few short months ago, we were seeing the American dream become a reality for more of our citizens than ever before. The greatest prolonged economic expansion in American history, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, the lowest unemployment rates ever for black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and pretty much every other demographic group. And then, courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party, the virus struck. The president quickly took action and shut down travel from China. Joe Biden and his Democrat allies, called my father a racist and a xenophobe for doing it. They put political correctness ahead of the safety and security of the American people. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:25:03 )  Fortunately, as the virus began to spread, the president acted quickly and insured ventilators got the hospitals that needed them most. He delivered PP and E to our brave frontline workers and he rallied the mighty American private sector to tackle this new challenge. There’s more work to do, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Job gains are outpacing what the so called experts expected, but Biden’s radical left wing policies would stop our economic recovery cold. He’s already talking about shutting the country down again. It’s madness. Democrats claim to be for workers, but they’ve spent the entire pandemic trying to sneak a tax break for millionaires and Democrat States, into the COVID relief bill. Then they attacked my father for suspending the payroll tax for middle class workers. In fact, if you think about it, Joe Biden’s entire economic platform seems designed to crush the working men and women. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:26:03 )  He supported the worst trade deals in the history of the planet. He voted for the NAFTA nightmare. Down the tubes went our auto industry. He pushed for TPP. Goodbye manufacturing jobs. Beijing Biden is so weak on China, that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden. They know he’ll weaken us both economically and on a world stage. Biden also wants to bring in more illegal immigrants to take jobs from American citizens. His open border policies would drive wages down for Americans at a time when low income workers were getting real wage increases for the first time in modern history. He’s pledged to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which were the biggest in our country. After eight years of Obama and Biden’s slow growth, Trump’s policies have been like rocket fuel to the economy and especially to the middle class. Biden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it in the swamp. That makes sense though, considering Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:27:14 )  For the past half century, he’s been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn’t do much in between. So if you’re looking for hope, look to the man who did what the failed Obama Biden administration never could do and built the greatest economy our country has ever seen. And President Trump will do it again. We will be stronger than ever because when we put our mind to it, there is no obstacle that America can’t surmount, except there’s a difference this time. In the past, both parties believed in the goodness of America. We agreed on where we wanted to go, we just disagreed on how to get there. This time, the other party is attacking the very principles on which our nation was founded. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the rule of the law. Thomas Jefferson famously said, “I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.” Our founders believed there was nothing more important than protecting our God given right to think for ourselves. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:28:29 )  Now the left, they’re trying to cancel all of those founders. They don’t seem to understand this important principle, in order to improve in the future, we must learn from our past, not erase it. So we’re not going to tear down monuments and forget the people who built our great nation. Instead, we will learn from our past so we don’t repeat any mistakes and we will work tirelessly to improve lives of all Americans. Joe Biden, and the radical left are now coming for our freedom of speech. They want to bully us into submission. If they get their way, it will no longer be the silent majority, it will be the silenced majority. This has to stop. Freedom of expression used to be a liberal value, at least before the radical left took over. Now the Republican party is the home of free speech. The place where anyone from any background can speak their mind and may the best ideas win. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:29:31 )  People of faith are under attack. You’re not allowed to go to church, but mass chaos in the streets gets a pass. It’s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school versus rioting, looting, and vandalism, or in the words of Biden and the Democrats, peaceful protesting. Anarchists have been flooding our streets and Democrat mayors are ordering the police to stand down. Small businesses across America, many of them minority owned, are being torched by mobs. The Democrat mayors pretend it’s not happening. They actually called it a summer of love. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:30:13 )  And that brings me to another important principle. Every American must be free to live without fear of violence in your country, in your communities and in your homes. All men and women are created equal and must be treated equally under the law. That’s why we must put an end to racism and we must ensure that any police officer who abuses their powers, is held accountable. What happened to George Floyd is a disgrace and if you know a police officer, you know they agree with that too, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that our police are American heroes. They deserve our deepest appreciation because no matter what the Democrats say, you and I both know when we dial 911, we don’t want it going to voicemail. So defunding the police is not an option. Everything starts with safety and security. You can’t have anything else without it. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:31:11 ) You can’t focus on building a better future for your children, without the peace of mind that they can study safely in their classrooms, play safely in their neighborhoods and sleep safely in their beds. But safety is only the beginning. Trump’s America is a land of opportunity, a place of promise. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that could afford the best schools and the finest universities, but a great education can not be the exclusive right of the rich and powerful. It must be accessible to all. And that’s why my dad is pro school choice. That’s why he’s called education access the civil rights issue, not just of our time, but of all time. It is unacceptable that too many African American and Hispanic American children are stuck in bad schools, just because of their zip code. Donald Trump will not stand for it. If Democrats really wanted to help minorities in underserved communities, instead of bowing to big money union bosses, they’d let parents choose what school is best for their kids. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:32:17 )  They’d limit immigration to protect American workers. They’d support the police who protect our neighborhoods. They’d learn how to negotiate trade deals that prioritize America’s interest for a change. They’d end the endless wars and quit sending our young people to solve problems in foreign lands. They’d cut taxes for families and workers. They’d create opportunity zones that drive investment into inner cities. In other words, if Democrats cared for the forgotten men and women of our country, they’d do exactly what President Trump is doing. America is the greatest country on earth, but my father’s entire worldview revolves around the idea that we can always do even better. Imagine the life you want to have, one with a great job, a beautiful home, a perfect family, you can have it. Imagine the country you want to live in, one with true equal opportunity, where hard work pays off and justice is serve with compassion and without partiality, you can have it. Donald Trump Jr.: ( 02:33:26 )  Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread, where heroes are celebrated and the good guys win, you can have it. That is the life, that is the country, that is the world that Donald Trump and the Republican party are after. And yes, you can have it because unlike Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats, our party is open to everyone. It starts by rejecting radicals who want to drag us into the dark and embracing the man who represents a bright and beautiful future for all. It starts by reelecting Donald J. Trump, president of the United States. Thank you and God bless America.",1789,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Tax cuts and jobs act was huge, manufacturing, deregulation, fair trade, these are things that affected real Americans. We have a champion in the Oval Office who has this business background. He actually understands the need for small businesses like my sisters, to survive. We aren’t the stereotypical conservative, I mean, we come from Hispanic descent and we’re millennial women, and that’s not what the media wants. And so somebody like AOC, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, this far left, these women come out with these very, very destructive political ideologies that are trying to infiltrate millennials and the next generation. I’ve decided to step up and say, “Well, we need a counter voice to these women.” Madeline Lauf: ( 02:37:47 )  There has been an assault on capitalism just generally and I think it’s very scary to imagine a Biden world where the progressive wing ideas are starting to take front and center stage. That will really choke the American economy. There will be over-regulation, over taxation, it’s very hard to innovate through those two things.

But regardless of the challenges presented to us, every four years, Americans come together to vote, to share stories of what makes our nation strong and the lessons we have learned that can strengthen it for further generations. Because while this election is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it is not solely about Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It’s about the promise of America, it’s about you and me, our challenges and heartbreaks, hopes and dreams. It’s about how we respond when tackling critical issues like police reform.

Do we want a society that breeds success or a culture that cancels everything it even slightly disagrees with? I know where I stand because you see, I am living my mother’s American dream. My parents divorced when I was seven years old and we moved in with my grandparents into a two bedroom home, with me, my mom and my brother sharing a room and one bed. My mom worked 16 hours a day to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. She knew that if we could find the opportunity, bigger things would come. I thought I had to use football to succeed in life and my focus on academics faded away. My freshman year, I failed out, I failed four subjects, Spanish, English, world geography, and even civics.

Because of her encouragement, I went to summer school and caught up. The next year, I met my mentor, John [Monice 00:21:55], a Chick-fil-A operator. John saw something in me that I could not see in myself and started teaching me valuable life lessons, like having a job would be a good thing, but creating jobs would be even better.

This initiative that the president and I worked together on, is now bringing more than $75 billion of private sector investment into distressed communities. I took those lessons to heart and started putting the pieces of my life back together. I realized a quality education is the closest thing to magic in America. That’s why I fight to this day for school choice, to make sure every child in every neighborhood has a quality education. I don’t care if it’s a public, private, charter, virtual or a homeschool, when a parent has a choice, their kid has a better chance and the president has fought alongside me on that. Later in life, I started my own small business, that’s why I know it is critical for us to have a tax code that encourages growth.

Republican,1,Tim Scott,5,02:43:18,"We actually saw revenues to the treasury increase after we lowered taxes in 2017, rested assured the Democrats do not want you to know that. After starting my small business and spending some time in local government, I decided to run for Congress in 2010. The district is based in Charleston, South Carolina, where the Civil War started, against a son of our legendary Senator, Strom Thurmond. You may be asking yourself, how does a poor black kid from a single parent household, run and win in a race crowded with Republicans, against a Thurmond, because of the evolution of the Southern heart. In an overwhelmingly white district, the voters judged me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. We live in a world that only wants you to believe in the bad news, racially, economically, and culturally polarizing news. The truth is our nations arc always bins back towards fairness. We are not fully where we want to be, but I thank God almighty, we’re not where we used to be. Sen.",180,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Republican,1,Tim Scott,6,02:44:38,"We are always striving to be better. When we stumble and we will, we pick ourselves back up and try again. We don’t give in to cancel culture or the radical and factually baseless belief that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s. We have work to do, but I believe in the goodness of America, the promise that all men and all women are created equal and if you’re watching tonight, I’m betting you do too. Over the past four years, we have made tremendous progress towards that promise. President Trump built the most inclusive economy ever. Seven million jobs created pre COVID-19 and two thirds of them went to women, African Americans and Hispanics. The first new major effort to tackle poverty in a generation, opportunity zones. We put hard earned tax dollars back in people’s pockets by cutting their taxes, especially for single parent households like the one I grew up in, cutting single mothers taxes, 70% on average.

Republican,1,Tim Scott,7,02:45:58,"President Trump supported these tax cuts for those single moms and other working families and signed these policies into law and our nation is better off for it. So I’m going to ask you, the American people, not to simply look at what the candidates say, but to look back at what they’ve done. This election is about your future and it is critical to paint a full picture of the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden said if a black man didn’t vote for him, he wasn’t truly black. Joe Biden said black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids. And while his words are one thing, his actions take it to a whole new level. In 1994, Biden led the charge on a crime bill that put millions of black Americans behind bars, President Trump’s criminal justice reform law, fixed many of the disparities Biden created and made our system more fair and just for all Americans.

Republican,1,Tim Scott,8,02:47:14,"Joe Biden also failed our nation’s historically black colleges and universities, heaping blame on them as they fought to ensure our young folks had access to higher education. Once again, to clean up Joe Biden’s mess, President Trump signed into law historically high funding for HBCUs, as well as a bill to give them permanent funding for the first time ever. And now in Joe Biden wants to come for your pocket books, unless of course, you’re a blue state millionaire. I’m serious, that’s one of their solutions for the pandemic. They want to take more money from your pocket and give it to Manhattan elites and Hollywood moguls, so they get a tax break. Republicans however, passed President Trump’s once in a generation tax reform bill, that lowered taxes for single moms, working families and those in need. So when it comes to what Joe Biden says he’ll do, look at his actions, look at his policies, look at what he already did and what he didn’t do while he’s been in Washington for 47 years.

Republican,1,Tim Scott,9,02:48:37,"Ladies and gentlemen, people don’t always see those failures because they think we’re having a policy debate on two sides of an issue, that is not what is happening. Our side is working on policy, while Joe Biden’s radical Democrats are trying to permanently transform what it means to be an American. Make no mistake, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution, a fundamentally different America. If we let them, they will turn our country into a socialist utopia. And history has taught us that path only leads to pain and misery, especially for hardworking people hoping to rise. Instead, we must focus on the promise of the American journey. I know that journey well. My grandfather’s 99th birthday would have been tomorrow. Growing up he had to cross the street if a white person was coming, he suffered the indignity of being forced out of school as a third grader to pick cotton and he never learned to read or write.

There are millions of families just like mine, all across this nation, full of potential, seeking to live the American dream.

Republican,2,Speaker 1,1,00:00,"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without life, there can be no liberty. Without liberty, there is no happiness. Without equality, there is no opportunity. America has strived, since its founding to promote equality under the law, to correct injustices and to ensure opportunity for all. It is a work in progress, not always perfect. Some look at American opportunity and see only problems. They want equal outcome, not equal opportunities. They criticize without solutions, demand wealth without work. Their ways are historical failures, evidenced by tyranny and poverty, a prevailing darkness in every country that has been tried.

The president has reactivated the White House Council on Native American Affairs, to promote economic development and rural prosperity in the Indian country. President Trump also strengthened the Supreme Court by nominating strong conservative judges like Neil Gorsuch, who supports Native American rights. Thank you for the opportunity to be here tonight. I’m excited to endorse President Trump’s reelection and Mr. President, we look forward to hosting you very soon. Come visit our land, we call it Dinehtah.

Republican,2,Jon Ponder,1,09:21,"I had always had this unshakeable sense that I know that I know, that life has to be more than what it was I’ve been living. I caught my very first felony conviction at 16 years old, and that type of behavior had led me into more and more arrests, getting in trouble until the age of 37 years old. I was arrested for a string of bank robberies and based off of my criminal history, there is a potential that a federal judge can sentence me up to 23 years in a maximum security United States, federal penitentiary. In that moment, I played a let’s make a deal with God. I asked God to climb into the robe of that judge, whether it’s 10 years or 50 years, I’m going to invest the rest of my life serving you. I stood before that federal judge. Judge Meehan took his glasses off, leaned back and said, “I don’t know why I’m going to do this,” but he said, “I’m not going to give you what you deserve.” Jon Ponder: ( 10:28 )  Then, he gave me a lesser sentence. As I laid on that stainless steel cell, shackled by my hands and my feet, I heard God utter into my spirit. “My son, I honored which you asked me to do.” He said, “Never forget the promise that you made to me.” Ever since that day I got up off that floor and my life went in 180 degree turn in the other direction.",254,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt

President Trump, he had made a bunch of promises. Let me just be transparent. When he first started talking about the things he was going to do, I’m sitting there going, wait a minute here. I mean, is he serious, because everything that he was saying that he wanted to do was the stuff that needs to be done.

Today, I’m thrilled to welcome him back to the White House. John’s life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption. John grew up without his father. As he tells it, my mother was strong, but she wasn’t able to keep us out of the gangs and off of the streets, and they were violent streets. At the age of 38, he was arrested for bank robbery. While Jon was in prison, he began reading the Bible and listening to Christian radio. One day he heard Reverend Billy Graham on the radio proclaim, “Jesus wants to be Lord of your life”. On that day, Jon dedicated his life to Christ. He spent the rest of his time in prison, studying the Bible.

In the last 10 years, since Jon was released, he has created one of the most successful reentry programs, Hope for Prisoners, in Las Vegas. I was led to speak there earlier this year.

But today, praise God, I am filled with hope, a proud American citizen who has been given a second chance. My transformation began in a prison cell where I’ve found myself a three-time convicted felon, facing yet another sentence. I gave my life to Jesus and made him a promise that I would spend the rest of my days helping the others like me.

My hope for America is that formerly incarcerated people will be afforded the opportunity to take advantage of the fact that we live in a nation of second chances. My hope for America is that law enforcement and people in the communities across our country can come together and realize that as Americans, we have more in common than we have differences.

After he was sentenced, Jon sent me a neck tie and a note, thanking me for treating him like a gentlemen. Five years later, when he got out of prison, Jon called me and wanted to meet for lunch.

What a sight. The most important man in the free world, shaking hands and pledging his administration support to ex- offenders. Their families were there. The community was there. What a great second chance. I also appreciate President Trump’s support for law enforcement. I always felt like I had strong support as an FBI agent, but there’s nothing worse than knowing you’re being second- guessed when you’re doing your job.

Republican,2,Rand Paul,1,19:58,"Good evening. I’m Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. Donald Trump and I met many years ago, before he was running for anything. When I first met him, I recall being struck by how down to earth he was. He seemed like just a normal guy. Okay, a normal guy with his own plane and helicopter, but who’s counting? I was planning a medical mission trip to Guatemala to perform charity eye surgeries, and we needed money to fund the trip. Donald Trump offered to help and immediately came through for us. Not only did he support my medical mission to Guatemala, but he also contributed to another mission trip to Haiti, a year later. We performed hundreds of cataract surgeries in both countries. Nothing is more amazing than removing the bandages from a person’s eyes and watching them as they see their loved ones again?",145,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Rand Paul,2,20:48,"Donald Trump helped me make that happen. A few years later, we were opponents, both running for president, and we all know how that turned out. But I’m proud of the job Donald Trump has done as president. I don’t always agree with him, but our occasional policy differences are far outweighed by our significant agreements. But more important than simple agreement is accomplishment. President Trump gets things done. When some in Congress wanted a so-called revenue-neutral tax plan, Donald Trump and I worked together to make sure that it was a true tax cut. I brought President Trump an idea for better, less expensive health insurance called Association Health Plans. Donald Trump overturned years of red tape and bureaucrats, and he made it happen. While others talked about criminal justice reform, President Trump actually signed the First Step Act. The first real reform in a generation and one that sought to undo the harm that others, like Joe Biden. Have done for those of us who lament the Biden crime bill that locked up a generation of young black men, remember that Biden bragged about a bill that still wreaks havoc among people of color.",196,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt

I’ll never forget that evening. I can tell you the president not only felt the pain of these families, but that the president is committed to ending this war. President Trump is the first president in a generation to seek to end war, rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home. Madison once wrote, “No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continuous warfare.” I’m proud to finally see a president who agrees with that.

I have to confess I didn’t support Trump in 2016, skeptical that he shared my conservative views, I expected him to flip flop on his campaign promises, but he has followed through on his promises including last week when he brokered a deal to end European Union tariffs of 8% on main live lobsters and up to 20% on main lobster products, which is great news for Maine’s lobster men and women.

They did it to cater to environmental activists. Although Maine’s lobstermen, don’t fish, there Obama’s executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the Fisheries Counsel’s input. President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input. he supports a process that seeks and respects fisherman’s views.

Truth be told, until I married my cute farmer from Grantsburg a long time ago, I was a city slicker from Minneapolis, which is about 70 miles south of us. Donald Trump became president in the middle of the great depression for dairy farmers in Wisconsin. In 2016, prices were horrible and longtime generational farms across the nation were going out of business. In 2017, our 120- year old barn, which served as our milking center, caught fire and burned to the ground. Our cows were spared, but because they needed to be milked three times a day, farmers, friends, and complete strangers from all over Northern Wisconsin helped haul them to other farms where they stayed until we could rebuild. By the end of 2018, we had a new state-of-the-art robotic milking facility that allows our cows to milk themselves three times a day.",174,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt

That support and focus on negotiating new trade deals, gave us the confidence to rebuild our barn and dairy operation.

More recently, I helped the team craft Donald Trump’s economic plan during the campaign. It was a roaring success, inheriting a stagnant economy on the front end of recession. The program of tax cuts, historic rollback of onerous regulations that crippled small business, unleashing energy to become the world’s number one producer, and free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to bolster manufacturing, agriculture, technology, and other sectors. The economy was rebuilt in three years. Unemployment fell to the lowest rate of 3.5%. Blue collars, African Americans, Hispanics, women, all groups benefited enormously. Everyone was better off. A rising tide lifting all boats. Then came a once in 100 year pandemic. It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic, hardship and heartbreak were everywhere.

A V shaped recovery is pointing to better than 20% growth in the second half of this year. Now looking ahead, more tax cuts and regulatory rollback will be in store, payroll tax cuts for higher wages, income tax cuts for the middle class, capital gains tax cuts for investment, productivity, and jobs. Much more regulatory relief for small businesses. In economic terms folks, this is no time for a $4 trillion tax hike.

As Americans, we know the first line of the first amendment protects our freedom of religion, but what we often forget, the actual words, are free exercise of religion. That means living out our faith in our daily lives, in our schools, in our jobs and yes, even in the public square. Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that the voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced, not bullied. But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack. Democrats tried to make faith organizations pay for abortion-inducing drugs. Democrats tried to force adoption agencies to violate their deeply-held beliefs. Democrats pressured schools to allow boys to compete in girl sports and use girls locker rooms. Those are the facts.

This election is a make or break for workers who are carrying on the legacy of men like them. Since the Iron Range economy is vulnerable to economic trends and to foreign trade, we have always needed a strong voice in Washington. We looked to Democrats to fill that void for many years because we actually thought they cared about our welfare. Not anymore. The radical environmental movement has dragged the Democratic party so far to the left, they can no longer claim to be advocates of the man. This is hard for me to say because I am a lifelong Democrat.

Four years later, the Iron Range is roaring back to life, and we have one man to thank, president Donald Trump. He made good on his promises by cutting our taxes, rolling back senseless regulations, and delivering trade deals that put America’s interests first. But the fight is not over. Joe Biden has allowed radicals like AOC to craft his environmental policies. Their so-called Green New Deal is a job-killing disgrace dreamt up by people who don’t live in the real world.

When I was in college, Planned Parenthood approached me at a volunteer fair. They talked about helping women in crisis and their commitment to keep abortion safe, legal, and rare. I was convinced to volunteer and later offered a full-time job as a medical assistant before my promotion to director of the clinic, I truly believed I was helping women, but things drastically changed in 2009. In April, I was awarded Planned Parenthood’s employee of the year award and invited to their annual gala where they present the Margaret Sanger Award named for their founder. And Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics. Her goal when founding Planned Parenthood was to eradicate the minority population. Today, almost 80% of Planned Parenthood abortion facilities are strategically located in minority neighborhoods.

When I pushed back, underscoring Planned Parenthood’s public facing goal of decreasing abortions, I was reprimanded and told, abortion is how we make our money. But the tipping point came a month later when a physician asked me to assist with an ultrasound- guided abortion. Nothing prepared me for what I saw on the screen, an unborn baby fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction. And I’ll never forget what the doctor said next, “Beam me up Scotty.” The last thing I saw was a spine twirling around in the mother’s womb before succumbing to the force of the suction. On October sixth, I left the clinic looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life. I founded and currently run And Then There Were None, a non-profit organization that’s helped nearly 600 abortion workers transition out of the industry. For most people who consider themselves pro-life, abortion is abstract. They can’t even conceive of the barbarity. They don’t know about the products of conception room and abortion clinics where infant corpses are pieced back together to ensure nothing remains in the mother’s wombs, or that we joked and called it the pieces of children room. You see, for me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like. I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women, and I now support president Trump because he has done more for the unborn than any other president. During his first month in office, he banned federal funds for global health groups that promote abortion. That same year, he overturned an Obama-Biden rule that allowed government subsidy of abortion. He appointed a record number of pro-life judges, including two Supreme Court justices.

Because the truth was not important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti- conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Kentucky, well, so be it. That would teach him not to wear a MAGA hat.

This is a fight for freedom versus oppression, for opportunity versus stagnation. A fight to keep America true to America. I urge you to make judgment based on results and not rhetoric. If you believe in criminal justice reform, there is only one president that passed the First Step Act, giving people a second chance, a chance at a life once again and if you believe in expanding quality and affordable healthcare, only President Trump, my father signed the right to try into law the favored nations clause and other actions to lower drug prices and keep Americans from getting ripped off.",150,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt

This manipulation of what information we receive impedes our freedoms, rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness amongst us. Why are so many in media and technology and even in our own government so invested in promoting a biased and fabricated view? Ask yourselves, why are we prevented from seeing certain information? Why is one viewpoint promoted while others are hidden?

Many students find themselves suppressing their beliefs to fit into what the acceptable groupthink is. In short, our nation suffers by inhibiting our diversity of thought and inclusion of ideas. Working together outside of our political comfort zones, we’ll accomplish so much more. Some cynical politicians do not seem to believe in the miracle of America. Well I do.

It’s also home to people who care for one another, who work hard, who love this country, and are truly grateful for the freedoms it provides. As I like to say, Iowa is one big small town, neighbor helping neighbor is in our DNA. From the sick farmer who can’t harvest his crops to the single mom who loses her job and is struggling to get back on her feet, the town, the community helps them get through it. But what happens when a storm rips through almost the entire state? When it’s not one farmer who lost his crop, but hundreds? When it’s not one neighbor who is without food, but thousands? That happened just two weeks ago. A storm called a derecho with hurricane force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops, left thousands without power. It destroyed homes, wrecked lives, and left devastation in its wake. It was the worst storm in our state’s history and Iowans did what you expect Iowans to do.

His pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda has ushered in historically low unemployment, record job creation, higher wages, and rising home ownership. The president is fighting to rescue American jobs and industries for places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico. Jobs that were needlessly shipped overseas.

Republican,2,Eric Trump,1,01:45:05,"Good evening America. When I stood on this convention stage four years ago, no one fully understood the historic change that was about to take place. We could all feel it. Something was happening. A movement was forming just below the surface. The forgotten men and women voiceless in Washington D.C, were preparing to rise up. Our movement followed the pattern of so many that came before us. First, we were ignored. Then we were laughed at. Then they fought us and then together we won. From that moment forward, America came first. America started winning again. America became respected again. But with every movement, there’s a counter movement. In the view of the radical Democrats, America is a source of the world’s problems. As a result, they believe the only path forward is to erase history and forget the past. They want to destroy the monuments of our forefathers. They want to disrespect our flag, burn the stars and stripes represent patriotism and the American dream.",167,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Eric Trump,2,01:46:09,"They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee while our armed forces laid down their lives every day to protect our freedom. They do not want the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Many of them don’t want one nation under God. The Democrats want to defund and disrespect our law enforcement. The Democrats want an America where your thoughts and opinions are censored when they do not align with their own. President Reagan said, “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for, and it must be protected.” This is a fight that we are in right now, and it is a fight that only my father can win. My father ran not because he needed the job, but because he knew hard working people across this great country were being left behind.

Their so-called leaders are bowing to China, bribing Iran, and spending more time worrying about how they’d be received by the elites in Paris than how Americans would provide for their families in Pittsburgh. Our family lost friends but it only pushed us to fight harder. My father pledged to every American in every city, state, and town that he was going to make America great again. And so began the great American comeback. Almost immediately taxes were slashed, regulations were cut, and the economy soared to new heights, heights never seen before. Wages went through the roof. Unemployment reached historic lows, especially for black Americans, Hispanic Americans and women. Trade deals were ripped up and renegotiated.

My father rebuilt the mighty American military, adding new jets, aircraft carriers. He increased wages for our incredible men and women in uniform. He expanded our military defense budget to $721 billion per year. America was no longer weak in the eye of the enemy.

Republican,2,Eric Trump,5,01:49:24,"Most politicians spend their entire careers in Washington D.C and get absolutely nothing accomplished for example, Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a politician who has been in government for 47 years.

Every day my father fights for the American people, the forgotten men and women of this country, the ones who embody the American spirit, which is unlike anything else in the world. It built the New York city skyline. It built the Hoover Dam. And soon under my father’s leadership, it will send Americans to Mars.

Ronald Reagan’s quote ends with this simple warning. “One day we could spend our sunset years telling our children what it was once like in the United States, where men and women were free.” Under President Trump, freedom will never be a thing of the past.

Republican,2,Daniel Cameron,1,01:56:48,"Good evening. My name is Daniel Cameron. I’m 34 years old and the first African American Attorney General in Kentucky history. It is an honor to be with you as a proud Republican and supporter of Donald J. Trump. I was raised in Kentucky, just a few miles from Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace. Our first Republican president believed in compassion, self-reliance, freedom, equality, and justice. Sadly, there are some who don’t believe in this wisdom or in the better angels of our shared American history, as they tear down the statues of people like Ulysses S. Grant, Frederick Douglass and even Mr. Lincoln himself. Lincoln said, “Any nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure.” And for Republicans, our heroes are those who propelled an imperfect nation ever forward, always striving to make life better for everyone. Even as anarchists mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police and innocent bystanders, we Republicans do recognize those who work in good faith towards peace, justice, and equality.",168,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Daniel Cameron,2,01:58:07,"In fact, it was General Dwight Eisenhower, a future Republican president, who said, “Democracy is a system that recognizes the equality of humans before the law.” Whether you are the family of Breonna Taylor or David Dorn, these are the ideals that will heal our nation’s wounds. Republicans will never turn a blind eye to unjust acts, but neither will we accept an all-out assault on Western Civilization. My values were shaped by my faith and by my parents. I worked at their small coffee shop, meeting people from all walks of life. And I realized something, no matter who we are, everyone needs a cup of coffee. That lesson stuck with me because despite our differences, we all want the same things: for our children to have more opportunities than we did; to feel the dignity of work; and to believe that if you play by the rules, you can make a good life for yourself and your family.",160,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Daniel Cameron,3,01:59:14,"So the question is, will we choose the path that gives us the best chance to meet those universal desires? Or will we go back to a time when people were treated like political commodities, who can’t be trusted to think for themselves? I think often about my ancestors who struggled for freedom. And as I think of those giants and their broad shoulders, I also think about Joe Biden, who says, “If you aren’t voting for me, you ain’t black.” Who argued that Republicans would put us “back in chains.” Who says there is no diversity of thought in the black community. Mr. Vice President, look at me. I am black. We are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. My mind is my own. And you can’t tell me how to vote because of the color of my skin. Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world that is craving forward-looking leadership.",158,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Daniel Cameron,4,02:00:15,"There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements. Joe Biden would destroy jobs, raise our taxes and throw away the lives of countless unborn children. And he is captive to the radical left, a movement committed to cancel culture and the destruction of public discourse. They believe your skin color must dictate your politics. And if you fail to conform while exercising your God given right to speak and think freely, they will cut you down. The politics of identity, cancellation and mob rule are not acceptable to me. Republicans trust you to think for yourself and to pursue your American dream however you see fit. Mr. Lincoln said, “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise to the occasion.” I believe Donald Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his own failed record, and by the radicals who dominate his party.",171,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Daniel Cameron,5,02:01:29,"Let’s be honest. No one is excited about Joe Biden. And so I ask you to judge the record. On criminal justice reform, Joe Biden couldn’t do it, but President Trump did. On the economy, Joe Biden couldn’t do it, but President Trump did build an economy that worked for everyone, especially minorities, and he will do it again. And on immigration, Joe Biden promises more to illegal immigrants than he does to you. But President Trump believes his highest duty is to the American worker. The choice is clear. Let me close with something my mom told me, this country’s many faces comprise a family, not separate parts to be divided against each other. And like any family, we care for one another. We grieve together. We share our burdens and our struggles and we celebrate our successes. And though we fuss and fight, we are not enemies.

As Susan’s husband and Nick’s dad, Susan and Nick are more safe and their freedoms more secure because President Trump has put his America first vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked. President Trump understands what my great fellow Kansan, President Eisenhower said, “For all that we cherish and justly desire for ourselves or for our children, the securing of peace is the first requisite.” Indeed, the primary constitutional function of the national government is ensuring that your family and mine are safe and enjoy the freedom to live, to work, to learn and to worship as they choose.

And he has ended the ridiculously unfair trade arrangement with China that punched a hole in our economy. Those jobs, those jobs are coming back home. In North Korea, the president lowered the temperature and against all odds got the North Korean leadership to the table. No nuclear tests, no long range missile tests and Americans held captive in North Korea came home to their families, as did the precious remains of scores of heroes who fought in Korea. Today, today because of President Trump, NATO is stronger, Ukraine has defensive weapons systems, and America left a harmful treaty so our nation can now build missiles to deter Russian aggression.",167,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt

Today, today because of the president’s determination and leadership, the ISIS caliphate is wiped out, it’s gone. It’s evil leader, Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, is dead, and our brave soldiers, they’re on their way home. The president exited the U.S from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran and squeezed the Ayatollah, Hezbollah and Hamas. The president too moved the U.S. embassy to this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland, and just two weeks ago, the president brokered a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This is a deal that our grandchildren will read about in their history books. You know, as a soldier, I saw firsthand people desperate to flee to freedom, the way each of us can best ensure our freedoms is by electing leaders who don’t just talk, but who deliver. An American hostage, imprisoned in Turkey for two years, Pastor Andrew Brunson, said upon his release that he survived his ordeal with these words of scripture, “Be faithful, endure and finish well.” If we stay the course, we will.

Republican,2,Melania Trump,9,02:21:03,"One special memory from that trip is of a young boy I had the privilege of visiting while at Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, Italy. While there, I read a little boy a story and learned that he and his family had been waiting for a heart for a very long time, and he had a grim prognosis. His situation brought my staff and me to tears, and we spoke of a little ELLs as we flew to Belgium for the next part of our trip. Upon landing just a few hours later, we learned that a heart had been donated and would be going to the little one. I think about him often, along with so many amazing and strong young patients across our own country.",127,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,10,02:21:55,"More profound and sadly unavoidable examples of our country’s strength and character have appeared in the communities that have been impacted by natural disasters. Hurricanes, tornadoes, and flooding may show the ugly side of mother nature, but in their aftermath, they can show us a beautiful side of humanity. My husband and I have visited many places that have been affected by natural disaster, and we are deeply moved by the strength of the people who have lost everything and the kindness of neighbors and communities. The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another. I recognize the stories I just told are about people who survive extraordinary circumstances, but Donald and I are also inspired by the millions of Americans who wake up each day with a simple, yet courageous goal of providing for their families and keeping them safe. You are the backbone of this country. You are the people who continue to make the United States of America what it is and who have the incredible responsibility of preparing our future generations to leave everything even better than they found it. Just as you are fighting for your families, my husband, our family, and the people in this administration are here fighting for you. No matter the amount of negative or false media headlines or attacks from the other side, Donald Trump has not and will not lose focus on you. He loves this country and he knows how to get things done. As you have learned over the past five years, he’s not a traditional politician. He doesn’t just speak words. He demands action and he gets results. The future of our country has always been very important to him, and it is something that I have always admired. In fact, it is to help ensure a better future for our next generation that I launched Be Best, my initiative to help children achieve their fullest potential. Be Best has one simple goal: teaching youth about the importance of their wellbeing, both mentally and physically. This also includes understanding online safety and the danger of opioid and drug abuse.",361,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,11,02:24:52,"Through Be Best, my office and I have been able to highlight people, programs and organizations that are doing extraordinary things in our country and around the world. I continue to believe that by shining a light on these positive examples, others across the country and globe will become inspired to theater a part for our next generation. Helping children is not a political goal. It is our moral imperative. When I think back to a defining moment of Be Best, my mind goes to a trip I took to Africa. On that vast and beautiful continent, I was able to visit the countries of Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. One of those visits in particular had a profound impact on me. Ghana on the coast of West Africa was the first stop on my trip, and I experienced firsthand it’s warm people and their traditions.",146,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,12,02:26:04,"While there, I visited the Cape Coast Castle and learn more about the beginning of a cruel and often deadly journey in the era of the slave trade. I was horrified when I listened to the guide tell me so many inhumane stories, and I gained new perspectives. This time in our history, we must never forget so that we can ensure that it never happens again. Like all of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country. It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage people to focus on our future while still learning from our past. We must remember that today, we are all one community comprised of many races, religions and ethnicities. Our diverse and storied history is what makes our country strong, and yet we still have so much to learn from one another.",150,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,13,02:27:17,"With that in mind, I’d like to call on the citizens of this country to take a moment, pause and look at things from all perspectives. I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the color of a person’s skin. Instead of tearing things down, let’s reflect on our mistakes. Be proud of our evolution and look to our way forward every day. Let us remember that we are one nation under God, and we need to cherish one another.",117,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,14,02:28:16,"My husband’s administration has worked to try and affect change when it comes to issues around race and religion in this country. He’s the first president to address a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to call upon countries across the world to end religious prosecution and honor the right of every person to worship as they choose. He has made substantial investments in our historically Black colleges and universities. This president also continues to fight for school choice, giving parents more options to help their children flourish. My husband knows how to make a real change. From the day that I met him, he has only wanted to make this country the best it can be. For many years, I watched him grow concerned and frustrated, and I’m so proud to see the many things he has done in such a short time. America is in his heart, so while at times we only see the worst of people and politics on the evening news, let’s remember how we come together in the most difficult times.",179,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,15,02:29:40,"And while debate rage on about issues of race, let’s focus on the strides we have made and work together for a better tomorrow for everyone. Our administration has also devoted historic resources and produced lifesaving results by raising awareness around opiod addiction and drug abuse, especially for children. When so often the headlines are filled with gossip, I want to take this moment to encourage the media to focus even more on the nation’s drug crisis. This disease is one that affects everybody. It pays no attention to race, age or socioeconomic status. Addiction has touched every part of our society in some way, and now more than ever, we have programs in medicine to combat it. We just need to talk about it openly, and you, the media, have the platforms to make that happen.",137,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,16,02:30:48,"To the media industry and as a country, I ask that we all commit to helping in our fight against drug addiction, by talking about it even more. Especially as we battle the COVID pandemic, we need to remember that suicides are on the rise as people who are struggling with loneliness and addiction feel they have nowhere to turn. Parents, please talk to your children. Teachers and caregivers, pay attention to signs of addiction. Lawmakers, pass legislation that allows those who ask for help to do so safely and without fear, and to provide resources for organizations that help people impacted by addiction. When the stigma is removed, people will no longer be ashamed to ask for help and lives will be saved. And if you are struggling with addiction, there is no shame in your illness. Please seek help. You’re worth it.",144,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,17,02:31:59,"In my next four years as first lady, I will continue to build upon Be Best and work with individual states to pass legislation to take care of our most vulnerable. I plan to continue the work I have started with children in foster care, as well as the minority communities and tribal nations. I want to ensure children are being protected and communities have the resources needed to combat drug addiction and child neglect or abuse. Like my husband and the administration, I will continue to encourage education that supports a child’s individual needs. It is vital that children are given the building blocks to succeed. I also look forward to continue my work to restore The People’s House, which is a lasting symbol of pride for our nation. I believe this iconic home needs to be cared for and preserved, so it can be enjoyed by the people of this country and visitor from around the world for years to come. I’m passionate about this beautiful house, the grounds, and all they represent.",175,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,18,02:33:18,"And now I have a special message for the mothers of this country. This modern world is moving so fast, and our children face challenges that seem to change every few months. Just like me, I know many of you watch how mean and manipulative social media can be, and just like me, I’m sure many of you are looking for answers, how to talk to your children about the downside of technology and their relationships with their peers. Like every parent in this country, I feel there are so many lessons to teach our son and the responsibilities as his mother, but there just not enough hours in the day to do it all. I remind myself that I’m more fortunate than most, and still have days that I look for wisdom and strength to the very best I can for him. To mothers and parents everywhere, you’re warriors.",150,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,19,02:34:24,"In my husband, you have a president who will not stop fighting for you and your families. I see how hard he works each day and night, and despite the unprecedented attacks from the media and opposition, he will not give up. In fact, if you tell him he cannot be done, he just works harder. Donald is a husband who supports me in all that I do. He has built an administration with an unprecedented number of women in leadership roles, and has fostered an environment where the American people are always the priority. He welcomes different points of view and encourage thinking outside of the box. I know I speak for my husband and the family when I say we are so grateful that you have trusted him to be your president, and we will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years. As you have heard this evening, I don’t want to use this precious time attacking the other side, because as we saw last week, that kind of talk only serves to divide the country further. I’m here because we need my husband to be our president and commander-in-chief for four more years. He’s what is best for our country. We all know Donald Trump makes no secrets about how he feels about things. Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not, you always know what he’s thinking, and that is because he’s an authentic person who loves this country and its people and wants to continue to make it better. Donald wants to keep your family safe. He wants to help your family succeed. He wants nothing more than for this country to prosper, and he doesn’t waste time playing politics.",298,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-2-transcript.txt
Republican,2,Melania Trump,20,02:36:48,"Almost four years ago, we went into election day completely underestimated. Despite what is being said again this year, I know just as you do that, Americans will go to the polls and will, on the behalf of their families, our economy, our national security and our children’s future. To vote for those ideas is not a partisan vote. It is a common sense vote, because those are goals and hopes that we all believe in. I believe that we need my husband’s leadership now more than ever in order to bring us back once again to the greatest economy and the strongest country ever known.

Republican,3,Speaker 1,1,00:00,"Thing, it was never intended to be, but the spirit of heroism stands in the breach. It lives in the heart. It breathes in the soul and is woven into the courageous fabric of Americans, like you. It preserves liberty. It strengthens families. It empowers the extraordinary. The spirit of heroism inspires us to act when others are in need, to do the right thing. Join us tonight. Dream heroic dreams.

Republican,3,Speaker 3,1,01:19,"Lord, all mighty God, we come before you this evening and pray for your divine protection over our brothers and sisters in the path of storms along our Gulf Coast. You are our rock and our shelter in the midst of the storms of life. You are the God who commands the winds and the waves, and we pray that you will provide refuge to our people. Oh Lord, you have granted us certain natural rights, such as the right to speak freely, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, as well as religious freedom, the right to assemble and the right to self-defense. Only in America have these God-given rights so flourished and been categorized as belonging to the people, embodying the very essence of our government. Father, we pray that this outlook and mindset, this form of government continues, as has been our history, especially now when to our horror, it is being challenged.",155,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Speaker 3,2,02:29,"So, we pray that God gives strength and health to our President, who has splendidly demonstrated daily, his determination to defend and maintain the God-given rights of our citizens as enshrined in our constitution, and in our declaration, eloquently passed down through our Judeo-Christian tradition. President Trump has stood up fearlessly against those who are corrupting the term social justice, so as to deny Americans, their birthright and these divine gifts. May God protect him. May God bless all those in government and among our citizens who seek to honor, defend and preserve our heritage.",95,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Speaker 3,3,03:19,"This land was founded in an epic and providential moment. Like the revelation at Sinai, it was the moment when the vision of God rendezvoused with this soaring and Nobel plans of appointed men. Yet, every so often, a pace, various generations, we are compelled to resurrect and give rebirth to our providential beginning, to renew our present days with the exuberance of those founding days. Perhaps that is what is meant when we say make America great again. We pledge to vigilantly protect and tend the garden, so as to imbibe its blessed fruits. May God continue to make America great, and may we continue to be his people, one nation, under God. Let us say, amen.",118,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt

Republican,3,Kristi Noem,1,04:50,"Good evening. I’m Governor Kristi Noem, of South Dakota. I’m here tonight because I believe America is an exceptional nation, founded on three principles, equality, freedom, and opportunity. But today, our founding principles are under attack. This year, the choice for Americans is between a man who values these ideals and all that can be built because of them and a man who isn’t guided by these ideals, and coincidentally has built nothing. Remember, America’s battle for independence and fight for self-governance was something that had never been done before. Men of great intellect and wisdom like James Madison, the father of our constitution, hoped our constitutional republic would last for ages, mitigate the problems that would naturally arise from political factions and prevent tyranny. Madison also authored much of the Bill of Rights, because he understood the natural tendency of government to increasingly encroach on the people’s consent and thus, our freedom.",153,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Kristi Noem,2,05:55,"He urged his colleagues to adopt these amendments to enshrine in our constitution the ideals laid out in the Declaration of Independence, that all power comes from the people, that the government is created and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people. Our constitution guarantees the right to speak, to assemble, and to worship, the right to arm ourselves as a counterbalance to a standing army and the right to a fair and equitable criminal justice system. We must fight to protect these foundational rights from government interference and indifference. America is unique in the world. Governments power at all levels is limited to the confines of our constitution, which protects our God- given liberties and civil rights. We are not, and will not be the subjects of an elite class of so- called experts. We, the people are the government. Now at times, our country has struggled to live up to our founding principles. Another great American, Abraham Lincoln, knew that struggle better than anybody. When he was just 28 years old, Honest Abe saw wild and furious passion’s worse than savage mobs, he said, taking the place of reasoned judgment. He was alarmed by the increasing disregard for the rule of law throughout the country. He was concerned for the people that had seen their property destroyed, their families attacked and their lives threatened, or even taken away. These good people were becoming tired of and disgusted with a government that offered them no protection. Sound familiar? It took 244 years to build this great nation, flaws and all, but we stand to lose it in a tiny fraction of that time, if we continue down the path taken by the Democrats and their radical supporters. From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs.",311,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Kristi Noem,3,08:03,"The violence is rampant. There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee, have fled, but the people that can’t, good, hardworking Americans are left to fend for themselves. The Republican Party’s commitment to individual rights and self-government is as necessary today as it was in 1860, when we won our first presidential election. Our party respects individuals, based on who they are. We don’t divide people based on their beliefs or their roots. We don’t shun people who think for themselves. We respect to everyone equally under the constitution, and we treat them as Martin Luther King, Jr. wished, according to the content of their character, not the color of their skin. In just four years, President Trump has lifted people of all races and backgrounds out of poverty. He shrunk government. He put money back into the pockets of hardworking, ordinary Americans. He has advanced religious liberty.",152,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Kristi Noem,4,09:10,"He protected the Second Amendment. You can look back 50 years. You won’t find anyone that has surpassed President Trump’s success on these four issues alone. History chooses its heroes for the time in which they live. At our founding, Madison was one of the chosen. When the nation’s very existence was challenged, it was Lincoln’s turn. Thanks to these men, america is a land of hope. Their examples have been repeated in countless ways by simple Americans following their conscience, but there is another American hero to be recognized, and that is the common American. This is who President Trump is fighting for. He is fighting for you.",109,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Speaker 5,1,09:56,"I’m Scott Dane. I represent loggers and truckers in Minnesota, but I also represent a way of life. Logging has been a part of the great American story from the beginning. In fact, if you go to the Capitol rotunda and look up, you can see loggers on one of the panels, New England settlers carving out a new world from the wilderness. But logging is the most dangerous job in the country, but we embrace that risk because we know America was built by strong people, building things together. America needs us to keep building and we can’t wait to be a part of it. But the last time Joe Biden was in the White House, Minnesota lost nearly half of its mills, thousands of jobs and experienced nearly a decade of decline. It was a similar story in other parts of the country. The administration just didn’t seem to care.",152,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Speaker 5,2,11:06,"In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden, hasn’t done anything for the timber industry. When plants closed in Duluth, Sartell, Cook and Bemidji, they were just numbers on a paper to the Obama Biden administration. To me, they were people in jobs and families. Under Obama-Biden, radical environmentalist, who were allowed to kill the forests, wildfire after wildfire shows the consequences. Managed forests, the kind of my people work in, are healthy forests. Under President Trump, we’ve seen a new recognition of the value of forest management in reducing wildfires. We’ve seen new support for our way of life, where a strong back and a strong work ethic can build a strong middle class. We want to build families where we were raised and stand by communities that stood by us. We want that way of life available for the next generation, and we want our forests there too. President Trump, thank you for helping us do just that Marsha Blackburn: ( 12:28 )  Hi, I’m US Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee. America is a nation of heroes. In times of difficulty, we’re reminded that they’re all around us. They’re in the line with us at the grocery store, in the pew with us at church. They’re the regular Americans who step up to volunteer and serve when we need them most. They’ve stood at the forefront throughout this pandemic. The emergency room nurses who go back shift after shift, the medical researchers, developing a vaccine and therapies to combat what the Chinese communist regime unleashed on the world. Cookeville’s Double Springs Church of Christ members, lifting our country up in prayer and providing for those impacted by tragedy. But tonight I want to talk to you about another kind of hero. The kind Democrats don’t recognize because they don’t fit into their narrative. I’m talking about the heroes of our law enforcement and armed services.",316,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Marsha Blackburn,1,13:45,"LeftistS try to turn them into villains. They want to cancel them, but I’m here to tell you these heroes can’t be canceled. Tennessee is full of them. After all, we’re the Volunteer State. My dad served in the army in World War II. When he came home, he put on another uniform and for 30 years volunteered to help our underfunded Sheriff’s Department. I’m reminded of him when ever I see compassion and selflessness and others. When I see law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our community safe, in spite of the hatred thrown at them. When I see the heroes who volunteer to serve our country, putting their lives on the line for our freedom, many of these heroes called Tennessee home, and we could not be more proud of the brave men and women of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. The common thread between them is a deep- seated desire to serve a cause larger than themselves. They don’t believe their country owes them anything. They believe they owe their country and their fellow man. As hard as Democrats try, they can’t cancel our heroes. They can’t contest their bravery and they can’t dismiss the powerful sense of service that lives deep in their souls. They tried to defund them, our military, our police, even ICE, to take away their tools to keep us safe. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their radical allies, try to destroy these heroes because if there are no heroes to inspire us, government can control us. They close our churches, but keep the liquor stores and abortion clinics open. They say we can’t gather in community groups, but encourage protests, riots and looting in the streets.",294,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Marsha Blackburn,2,16:16,"If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything. That sounds a lot like Communist China, to me. Maybe that’s why Joe Biden is so soft on them. Why Nancy Pelosi says that China would prefer Joe Biden. Yeah. I bet they would. But, President Trump has stood up for our heroes every day. He stood by our law enforcement, our military and the freedoms we hold dear. He’s made good on his promise to put America first. I hope you will stand with me, as we send him back for four more years, with the clear message to the Democrats, you will never cancel our heroes.",121,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Dan Crenshaw,1,17:18,"Hi, I’m Congressman Dan Crenshaw. Eight years ago in the fields of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, a close friend and teammate laid down, cover fire against Taliban and surgeons so that I could walk, blind and bloodied to the medevac helicopter and survive. But he didn’t. Dave Orson was killed two months later. He died a hero to this great country. Here’s the truth about America. We are a country of heroes. I believe that. So should you. We are a people with a common set of ideals, conceived in liberty, people that have sacrificed time and again for our freedom and the freedom of others. That’s something no other country ever, anywhere can claim. Since 911, I’ve seen America’s heroes up close. Some of them saved my life. Some of them saved many other’s lives. Many of them never made it home. These heroes acted as if the whole struggle depended on them alone, as if any weakness on their part would be a reflection of the whole nation.",169,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Dan Crenshaw,2,18:22,"That’s called duty, and America has a long history of it. Our enemies fear us because Americans fight for good, and we know it. It gives us strength. When our heroes are trusted and equipped, then freedom prevails. The defeat of ISIS was the result of America believing in our heroes, our President having their backs and rebuilding our military, so we’d have what we needed to finish the mission. The cowering of the Iranian regime and the restoration of the deterrence once lost is the result of America believing in her own might again. America’s heroism isn’t relegated to the battlefield. Every single day we see them, if you just know where to look. It’s the nurse, who volunteers for back to back shifts, caring for COVID patients because she feels that’s her duty. It’s the parent who will relearn algebra because there’s no way they’re letting their kid fall behind while schools are closed.",156,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt

She holds back tears and takes care of her family because she must. This is what heroism looks like. It’s who we are, a nation of heroes and we need you now more than ever. We need to remind ourselves what heroism really is. Heroism is self-sacrifice. It’s not moralizing and lecturing over others when they disagree. Heroism is grace, not perpetual outrage.

From the jungles of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, I have gone where my nation asked. I have borne witness to soldier’s last moments on earth, their lives spent in hope and promise of a better future for all Americans. I was in the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001. I lost friends there that day. In the years that followed, I watched my daughter, son and son-in-law deploy to Afghanistan. I have looked into the eyes of my grandchildren, as they said goodbye to their fathers and hugged them one last time. I live to service. I understand sacrifice. I know leadership.

When President Donald Trump took office decades of failed foreign policy had crippled us.

Republican,3,Tera Myers,1,26:23,"Good evening. My name is Tara Myers. Tonight, I am here as a wife and mother, to share how education freedom has personally impacted my family, especially the life of my son, Samuel. Before Samuel was even born, I was told his life wouldn’t be worth living. When early tests revealed he had Down syndrome, our doctor encouraged me to terminate the pregnancy. He said, “If you do not, you will be burdening your life, your family, and your community.” I knew my baby was a human being, created by God and that made him worthy of life. I am thankful that President Trump values the life of the unborn. When we went to register Samuel for kindergarten, we were told to just put him where he would be comfortable. Don’t stress him out by trying to teach him. When we pushed for him to attend his neighborhood school with his sisters, we were told, “Just go home and let us do what we do.” Tera Myers: ( 27:28 )  When I inquired about functional learning, I was told, “This is all you get, like it or not.” Well, I did not like it. One size did not fit all. So, I helped fight to pass legislation in Ohio for a special needs scholarship, so that all students could choose the right program for their needs. I worked to start a new functional learning program at our local private school. Finally, Samuel had an appropriate place to learn. Last December, Samuel was invited to the White House to meet our President and share his thoughts on education freedom. He said, “School choice helped my dreams come true. My school taught me the way I learn best. I was able to fit in. I made many friends. I became a part of my community. My teachers helped me become the best I can be.” Tera Myers: ( 28:25 )  President Trump shook my hand and said, Wonderful job, mom. Your son is amazing.” Unlike the doctor who told me to end Samuel’s life before it even began, President Trump did not dismiss my son. He showed Samuel, he valued him and was proud of what he accomplished. President Trump gave Samuel an equal seat at the table. Tonight, I would like to extend my thanks to President Trump and his administration for their work towards making every student’s dream of a meaningful education, a reality, and for fighting to ensure every child in America has an equal seat at the table of education freedom, and an equal opportunity in life. Thank you, and may God bless America.",436,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt

The other, determined to see all people free. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott felt the call to fight for that freedom, when they were selected as delegates for an anti-slavery convention. But, upon arrival, were told they could not speak or vote at the male-dominated event. On July 9th, 1848, Mott, Stanton, and three other women met for tea. By the end of the day, they’d formed a coalition with the sole purpose of gaining the right for women to vote, so they in turn would be free to fight for the freedoms of others. Women across America united and formed activist groups, working tirelessly to win the vote for American women. The unconquerable Susan B.

As I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President Trump, calling to check on me. I was blown away.

At the time I had only met President Trump on a few occasions, but now, I know him well, and I can tell you that this president stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions.

For decades, he has elevated women to senior positions in business and in government. He confides in and consults us, respects our opinions, and insists that we are on equal footing with the men. President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the world of politics by empowering me to manage his campaign to its successful conclusion. With the help of millions of Americans, our team defied the critics, the naysayers, the conventional wisdom, and we won. For many of us, women’s empowerment is not a slogan.

As followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life against the politically correct or fashionable of today.

They don’t have pride in our country and because they no longer ask what can I do for my country, only what the country should be doing for them. They don’t have pride in themselves. That’s wrong. When I was an officer in the army, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I’m so proud of their sacrifices and the opportunity this provided for so many millions. America remains the land of opportunity, no matter what the other side says or believes. There’s a statue of me at Notre Dame. I guess they needed a place for the pigeons land, but if you look closely, you will see these three words there, trust, commitment, and love.

I use these three rules to make choices about everything, my beloved wife of 59 years, athletes I coached, and of course, politicians, even President Trump. I ask myself three things, one, can I trust them? When a leader tells you something, you got to be able to count on it. That’s President Trump. He says what he means, he means what he say and he’s done what he said he would do at every single turn. One of the important reasons he has my trust is because nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump.

President Trump is committed. A third question I ask is do they love people. Do they care about others? To me this is very clear. President Trump has demonstrated through his prison reform, advocating for school choice, and welfare reform that he wants Americans from all walks of life to have the opportunity to succeed and live the American dream.

It’s where almost 250 years ago, brave patriots fought in the Battles of Saratoga to turn the tide of the Revolutionary War. It’s where 40 years ago in Lake Placid a team of amateur hockey players out-hustled, out-skated and defeated the Soviet Union, stunning the world and giving us the unforgettable Miracle on Ice, and today, it’s home to Fort Drum and the historic 10th Mountain Division, the most deployed unit in the U.S. Army since 9/11, where I saw firsthand President Trump graciously thank and honor our men and women in uniform and sign the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade. Since our nation’s founding, generation after generation of everyday Americans served and sacrificed to preserve and strengthen the American dream. The vision of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the idea that if you work hard and dream big, you can achieve anything you imagine. I believe in the American dream because I’ve lived it. Like millions of Americans, I grew up in a small business family where I learned the values of hard work and determination. I was the first person in my immediate family to graduate from college, ran for Congress to serve Upstate New York, and am proudly the youngest Republican woman elected to Congress in history. I am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hardworking families and protect the American dream for future generations. Since his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats’ baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media’s endless obsession with it.

Before my accident I was 6’3″, I stood out in a crowd, but as I wheeled through the stadium, I felt invisible. At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference and my accident has given me new eyes to see and new ears to hear.

Abe Lincoln, 22 when he first ran for office. And my personal favorite, James Madison was just 25 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence. In times of peril, young people have stepped up and saved this country abroad and at home. We held the line, scaled the cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps and cracked codes. Yet today, political forces want to usher in the digital dark ages, a time of information without wisdom, and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized emotion-based voting and a radicalized identity politics that rejects Martin Luther King’s dream.

The US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression.

We lent a helping hand to our fellow Iowans who were literally underwater. We thought we had seen the worst, but 12 years later these same communities have faced an even more devastating disaster, the recent derecho storm.

I’m Lara Trump, daughter of Bob and Linda UNESCA, sister to Kyle, mother to Luke and Carolina and the daughter in law of our 45th president, Donald J. Trump. But tonight, I come to you simply as an American. My life began like many in our country. I grew up in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. My parents were small business owners and worked hard to make sure that my brother and I had everything we needed, but not everything we wanted. My parents raised me to believe that in America, I could achieve anything with hard work and determination, that the opportunities available to me were limited only by the size of my ambition, that I should dream big. And I did. Those very dreams are what led me to New York City. I’d heard the adage, “If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere.” And I intended to do just that. Never in a million years did I think that I would be on this stage tonight, and I certainly never thought that I’d end up with the last name Trump.",188,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt

Any preconceived notion I had of this family disappeared immediately. They were warm and caring, they were hard workers and they were down to earth. They reminded me of my own family. They made me feel like I was home. Walking the halls of the Trump organization, I saw the same family environment. I also saw the countless women executives who thrived there year after year. Gender didn’t matter, what mattered was the ability to get the job done. I learned this directly when, in 2016, my father-in-law asked me to help him win my cherished home state and my daughter’s namesake, North Carolina.

Under president Trump’s leadership, women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since World War II. 4.3 million new jobs have been created for women. In 2019 alone, women took over 70% of all new jobs. Female small business ownership remains at an all time high and 600,000 women have been lifted out of poverty, all since president Trump took office.

And I think about what I’d tell myself now, as we head towards the most critical election in modern history.

Will we remain the beacon of hope for those around the world fighting oppression, communism, and tyranny? The choice is ours. I know the promise of America because I’ve lived it.

He is a person of conviction, he is a fighter and will never stop fighting for America. He will uphold our values, he will preserve our families and he will build upon the great American edict that our union will never be perfect until opportunity is equal for all, including and especially for women. Our 40th president, Ronald Reagan, said it best. “The dreams of people may differ, but everybody wants their dreams to come true and America above all places gives us the freedom to do that. It’s up to us to keep this country a place where no dream is out of reach for our children and generations beyond.” Madison Cawthorn: ( 01:39:56 )  To my father-in-law, thank you for believing in me.

That day started out like any other day, she left for the gym early in the morning, I heard the garage door open. Seconds later, I heard the car horn. I went outside to see if she had forgotten something. What I saw was a Jeep blocking her car in the driveway. I noticed the bullet hole in Jackie’s window. I saw someone jumping into the Jeep and speeding away. Jackie had just been shot and killed in cold blood. We think this was a carjacking gone very wrong. Every time I open the garage door or stand in the driveway, I hear that horn. I see her slumped in the seat. When I go to bed at night, that sound and image haunt me. That’s my life sentence.

Among the most extraordinary was the Civil Rights movement. 60 years ago, segregation was legal and enforced. The simple act of sitting at a lunch counter could lead to physical harm, jail time, or worse. I know from personal experience walking into Woolworth Department Store on February 2nd, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I had experienced before. My friends had been denied service the day before because of the color of their skin. We knew it wasn’t right, but when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position in handcuffs, or on a stretcher, or even in a body bag.

In the end, segregation was abolished and our country moved a stepped closer to true equality for all. That’s what actual peaceful protest can accomplish. America isn’t perfect. We’re always improving. But the great thing about this country is that it’s not where you come from, it’s where you’re going. I was born on what some would call the wrong side of the tracks.

Yet, no candidate could bring themselves to admit that something had gone badly wrong with American foreign policy, that the American voter, the American soldier, and the American taxpayer had all been let down, except for one, Donald Trump.

So, for decades, while Washington politicians built a global system, American wages stagnated. Our great cities and industries were hollowed out.

After Donald Trump won the election, when they should have continued the American tradition of helping the president elect transition into the White House, they tried instead to undercut him even more.

Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. For the last four years, I’ve watched this President endure unrelenting attacks, but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. So, with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States. Serving the American people in this office has been a journey. I never expected. It’s a journey that would not have been possible without the support of my family. Beginning with my wonderful wife, Karen. She’s a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children, and she is one outstanding Second Lady of the United States. I’m so proud of you. We couldn’t be more proud of our three children, Marine Corps Captain Michael J. Pence and his wife, Sarah. Our daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, an author, and the wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond who is currently deployed and serving our nation in the United States Navy. Our youngest, a recent law school grad, our daughter Audrey and her fiance who like so many other Americans had to delay their wedding this summer. But we can’t wait for Dan to be a part of our family. In addition to my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight. My mom, Nancy. She is the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, and mom follows politics very closely. The truth be told, sometimes I think I’m actually her second favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. Thank you, mom. I love you. Over the past four years, I’ve had the privilege to work closely with our President. I’ve seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways, but there’s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is, a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. If you want a President who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he’s not your man. Now, we came by very different routes to this partnership, and some people think we’re a little bit different. I’ve learned a few things watching him, watching him deal with all that we’ve been through over the past four years, he does things in his own way, on his own terms. Not much gets past him. When he has an opinion, he’s liable to share it. He certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people. In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a doer, and few presidents have brought more independence, energy, or determination to that office. Four years ago, we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression, ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania.",594,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,9,02:10:52,"We witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values, freedom of religion, and the right to life. That’s when President Donald Trump stepped in. From day one, he kept his word. We rebuilt our military. This President signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, and created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years, the United States Space Force. With that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly 10 years. After years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, President Trump kept his word again. We reformed the VA and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes, and many joined us tonight in this historic Fort.",155,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,10,02:12:22,"Tonight, we have among us four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, a Gold Star mother of a gallant Navy SEAL, and wounded warriors from SoldierStrong, a group that serves our injured veterans every day. We are honored by your presence and we thank you for your service. With heroes just like these, we defend this nation every day. Under this Commander in Chief, we’ve taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their califate, and took down their leader without one American casualty. I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world’s most dangerous terrorist, Iran’s top general will never harm another American because Qasem Soleimani is gone.",138,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,11,02:14:12,"My fellow Americans, you deserve to know, Joe Biden criticized President Trump following those decisions, decisions to rid the world of two terrorist leaders. But it’s not surprising because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It’s no wonder that the Secretary of Defense under the Obama- Biden Administration once said that Joe Biden has been, and I quote, “Wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.” So, we’ve stood up to our enemies and we’ve stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.",131,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,12,02:15:21,"Closer to home, we appointed more than 200 Conservative judges through our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God-given liberties enshrined in our constitution, including the Second Amendment, right to keep and bear arms. When it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut and reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. In our first three years, businesses, large and small, created more than seven million good.",102,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,13,02:16:03,"Businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs all across America. Our country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. And on this 100th anniversary of a woman’s right to vote, I’m proud to report that under president Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years, and more Americans working than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again. And then the Coronavirus struck from China. Before the first case of the Coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now that action saved untold American lives. And I can tell you firsthand, it bought us invaluable time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II-",169,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,14,02:17:36,"President Trump marshaled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America, in both political parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today we’re conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers. We saw to the manufacture of 100,000 ventilators in a hundred days. And no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We build hospitals, surged military medical personnel, and enacted an economic rescue package to save 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we’re developing a growing number of treatments known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America.",149,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,15,02:19:01,"Now last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming. Well what Joe doesn’t seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles. And I’m proud to report that we’re on track to have the world’s first safe, effective Coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice in this year like no other, and all the hardship, we’re finding our way forward again. But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who’ve lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country we mourn with those who mourn, we grieve with those who grieve. And this night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God’s comfort for each of you. A country doesn’t get through such a time unless its people find strength within. The response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic.",171,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,16,02:20:47,"Veronica Sayez put on her scrubs every day, day in and day out went to work in one of New York City’s busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done and then, got back in her neighborhood and helped neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother William is a New York City firefighter, and they’re both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They’re with us tonight. And I say to them and to all of you; you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care. Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we’re slowing the spread, we’re protecting the vulnerable, and we’re saving lives, and we’re opening up America again. Because of the strong foundation that president Trump poured in our first three years, we’ve already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we’re not just opening up America again, we’re opening up America’s schools. And I’m proud to report that my wife Karen, that school teacher I’ve been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week.",196,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,17,02:22:54,"And so to all of our heroic teachers, and faculty, and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We’re going to stay with you every step of the way. In the days ahead as we open up America again, I promise you, we’ll continue to put the health of America first. And as we’ve worked to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play, and we all have a choice to make. On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself, who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear, to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of president Donald Trump in the White House. My fellow Americans, we’re passing through a time of testing, but in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we’ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities.",181,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,18,02:24:33,"President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country. So let me be clear. The violence must stop. Whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see American strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day when they walk out their door, they consider our lives more important than their own. People like Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.",181,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,19,02:26:27,"Dave’s heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day, and we’re privileged tonight to be joined by his sister, Angela. Angela, we say to you, we grieve with your family, and America will never forget or fail to honor Officer Dave Patrick Underwood. The American people know, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety. And from the first days of this administration, we’ve done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African American and minority communities across this land for four more years. Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America is, and I quote, an implicit bias against minorities. When asked whether he’d support cutting funding of law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America’s cities. The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.",179,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,20,02:28:35,"Under president Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. My fellow Americans we’re passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate, and many were asking, “Transition to what?” But last week, Democrats didn’t talk very much about their agenda and if I were them, I wouldn’t either. I mean, Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, and I quote, that many of the ideas he fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration, that millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors, instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves.",169,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,21,02:30:10,"The radical left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children, and in the process deprive our people of freedom, prosperity, and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom. Where president Trump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States, Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, and fracking, and impose the regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families. Where we fought for free and fair trade, and this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers. And he actually criticized president Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic.",185,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,22,02:31:38,"Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. And president Trump, he secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice, and president Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code. President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life, every day of this administration. Joe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion, right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it’s clear, Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. The choice in this election has never been clearer, and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot and the truth is, our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country.",173,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,23,02:33:12,"In this election, it’s not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It’s whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that’s fundamentally transformed into something else. We stand at a crossroads, America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity, Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline. But we’re not going to let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America, and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams and freedom. And every day, president Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day, our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day, president Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it’s our turn to fight for him.",189,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,24,02:34:56,"On this night, in the company of heroes, I’m deeply grateful, deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation, and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of it, and I will give that duty all that’s in me. In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully, we have a president with the toughness, energy, and resolve to see us through. Those traits actually run in our national character, as the invading force learned on approach to this Fort, in September of 1814, against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held, and when morning came, our flag was still here.",149,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Republican,3,Mike Pence,25,02:36:26,"My fellow Americans, we’re going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see, our flag is still there today. That star-spangled banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American Patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it’s our turn. So let’s run the race marked out for us. Let’s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents. Let’s fix our eyes on this land of heroes, and let their courage inspire. And let’s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom, and never forget, that where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. That means freedom always wins. My fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight, and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today inspired, and I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past. We will defend our freedom, and our way of life. We will reelect our president, and principled Republican leaders across the land, and with president Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God’s help, we will make America great again, again.

Where rights are not granted by government or claimed by identities, but are unalienable as members of the human race. Today, America’s greatness is challenged by those with extreme notions.

We have witnessed injustice. Anger and despair have flowed into the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this crucial hour.

They lifted up millions from poverty, hunger, and disease. They vanquished fascism and communism. A great nation because of great people, and no one has done more to protect and advance it than President Trump. As Republicans, we are proud to stand with him and to work for you. Together we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen and we will do it again. We confronted China head-on, tore up bad trade deals and made better ones, supported our men and women in uniform, and took out the world’s top terrorist. Achieved energy independence, defended the sanctity of life, and restored law and order at the border. But as every American knows, we face an invisible enemy that we didn’t ask for nor invite, but we will defeat it. We will defeat it because America is where innovation happens and we are developing a vaccine in record time. We will defeat it because President Trump unleashed a Marshall Plan for Main Street and put hardworking taxpayers back on their feet. We will defeat it because tough times don’t last. Tough Americans do and that is what this election is all about, you, not us.",222,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Kevin McCarthy,2,06:45,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They’re wrong. It’s about your family and your future and to secure what really matters. We will call on the bedrock of what makes us the greatest country in the world, the American promise. A promise that everyone is equal under God, under the Constitution, and under the law. A promise that government is accountable to we the people, a promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, your opportunities are endless. As Republicans, it’s our mission to renew the American dream, restore our way of life, and rebuild the greatest economy in the world. The socialist Democrats have a different agenda. They will dismantle our institutions, defund our police, and destroy our economy. So as you cast your vote this November, remember this. Four years ago, President Trump promised to be your voice. He kept that promise, but there’s still so much more to do. The choice before you could not be clearer. Forward in freedom or backward in socialism. Forward in prosperity, or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty, or backwards in more government control. I know which direction I’m headed. Join us as the best is yet to come. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 08:14 )  Hello. My name is Ja’Ron Smith. 20 years ago, I moved to Washington, D.C. to attend Howard University. I was at a crossroads, just like America is today. I grew up on Strandhill Road in Cleveland, a blue collar street in a blue collar city. When the media talks about forgotten places or working class people who are overlooked and struggling hard, there’s usually some stock photo of people who don’t look like me. They never seem to show people like my mom, who worked two jobs as a gas station clerk and a mom. She showed me how to persevere. They never seem to show people like my dad, who plowed snow in the winter and paved streets in the summer. Who stood by me through thick and thin and taught me strong values every day. They never seem to show people like me. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 09:45 )  At first, I didn’t live the values my parents taught me. I won a starting spot on the varsity football team but I only had a 1.9 GPA. But then I broke my leg. It took a broken leg for me to really get moving in life. I prioritized schoolwork, went to Howard, and ended up working for the President of the United States. Growing up, I never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes. It took a meeting with Republicans who shared my values to show me I was wrong. Donald Trump knows that in the work of revitalizing communities, America’s strength is Americas people and I can tell you, he really cares and he takes action. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 10:52 )  Every issue important to black communities has been a priority for him. Prison reform, rebuilding broken families, bringing jobs back to America, jobs in Cleveland, jobs in Detroit, jobs in Milwaukee. President Trump knows that education is the great equalizer. That’s why he secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities and is fighting hard for school choice. In the wake of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro, a moment of national racial consciousness. I have seen his true conscience. I just wish everyone could see the deep empathy he shows to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 12:04 ) President Trump has made it clear that if you want safe communities, you must have police departments with the highest standards. I will never forget Strandhill Road or the people of Cleveland. They’re tough, smart, and tell it like it is. That’s President Trump. For a New Yorker, he’s got a lot of Cleveland heart, and I’m proud to say that he’s my president.

Republican,4,Jeff Van Drew,1,15:52,"Good evening. My name is Jeff Van Drew. I speak to you as a member of the Republican Party, but it always wasn’t that way. How I became a Republican says a lot about today’s Democratic Party. I’m from South Jersey, where we work hard, look after our neighbors, and care about our communities. Years ago, I was a local dentist and was asked by the Democrats to run for a town council seat. I had my doubts and I explained that my views were middle of the road to conservative, but the local leaders said the Democratic Party was a big tent and that they accepted people like me. I was elected to council as a Democrat, but as I won seats for county office, state legislature, and then Congress, I noticed things were changing. The Democratic Party had become less accepting of American tradition, less believing in American exceptionalism, less supportive of traditional faith and family. This was not the party that I knew.",166,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt

The party had moved from liberal to radical. This new Democratic party wasn’t just for higher taxes. Now they were for open borders, against our police, and against our God-given rights. When the radical Democrats went after President Trump with impeachment, they made another mistake. Democratic leaders told me that I had to vote for impeachment or my life would be made difficult and I wouldn’t be allowed to run again. Listen, I’m from South Jersey, and you better come at me with more than just loud words and empty threats.

Let me tell you about Joe Biden. When the Democrats tried to order me around, I was ready, willing and able to say I’ve had enough with their radical socialist agenda. Do you really believe Joe Biden is ready, willing and most of all able to do the same? As Joe says, “Come on man.” Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president. When I’m at my local diner, I tell people that America is the best nation in the world and that President Trump has helped make it that way. Republicans, Independents, and even Democrats, they all know that in President Trump’s America, we have a strong military, strong support for our police, strong support for our veterans, and strong support for our seniors.

After serving my country in the Marine Corps, I worked various jobs, but I thought I needed a degree in order to have a career. I put myself into significant debt to earn my bachelor’s degree in finance. Despite my degree in all of my efforts, at one point, my boys and I even found ourselves homeless. After being laid off yet again, I received an email from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B’s Women in Construction Earn While You Learn apprenticeship program. I thought I’d give it a try.

Looking back, it wasn’t easy, but boy was it worth it. I felt empowered that I was learning new skills and able to support my family again, I worked hard, got promoted, and even got a few raises.

Republican,4,Dan Scavino,1,24:41,"My name is Dan Scavino. When I was 16 years old, I got a part-time job at a golf course just outside of New York City. One day, I was cleaning golf clubs when a man pulled into the parking lot. There wasn’t a single person who didn’t know who it was. Everyone’s jaws were on the ground. It was Donald Trump. All I could think was nobody will ever believe this at school tomorrow. I never would have imagined it at this moment, but I’ve now been at President Trump’s side for almost 30 years. All these years later, there’s a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together and taken with so many of you watching tonight. Because my personal story with Donald Trump in so many ways is yours too. He saw potential in me, the spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That’s how he views this country. We have also just scratched the surface of what we can do together.",190,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt

I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets. The media can be a fog machine, creating a partisan mist around everything that’s hard to see through, but in 2016, you navigated through it all. You found your way through the swamp and you arrived safely on the other side with Donald J. Trump as your new president. There are some things that were true then, reasons why you choose him as your country’s leader that remain true today. You know the president cannot be bought. The American people must know their president isn’t building his life, he’s building yours. He knows the president cannot be bullied. President Trump is the first leader who’s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class. You know the president cannot be beaten. He’s got a fighting spirit like so many of you do, and winning for America is what he does. While they call it chaos, President Trump calls it change. Just think about what we achieved together with President Trump. The strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment rate for almost all demographic groups, black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and so many more. He did that once, and he will do it again. You know it and I know it. We all just need somebody to believe in our capacity to do great things. Donald Trump believed in me when I was a teenage golf caddy and he was already one of the wealthiest, most famous people on the entire planet. He saw my potential even when I couldn’t. He sees greatness in our country too and in each of you, he believes the world you dream about at night can be yours.

I spoke at this convention four years ago and I’m back because I believe we need President Trump’s leadership now more than ever. Before the pandemic, President Trump built the greatest economy in our nation’s history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him. Financial markets hit all-time highs, unemployment was at an all-time low and we weren’t facing the lawless destruction that now is occurring in a few of our great cities. It blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society. Police departments and other law enforcement, even some fire departments, have faced opposition from many in this country, but they are always the people who are asked to step up when things are at their worst and put themselves at risk. That has certainly been the case during this ongoing pandemic. Come on America, defunding these vital positions is not the answer. The first responders – Dana White: ( 35:03 )  … positions is not the answer. The first responders have always taken care of us and now more than ever, we need to take care of them. Now, let’s talk about COVID and let’s be very honest about it. No one person and no one place could have anticipated the challenges that COVID would bring. But, President Trump has faced all these obstacles head-on. He immediately put protective measures in place and he reached out to the best and the brightest leading American businesses, across all industries, to discuss what he and his administration could do to get the economy back up and running safely.",305,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt

While we have certainly experienced a ton of negativity in 2020, President Trump’s mindset is to work tirelessly to find solutions to problems and help restore America. He did it once, and I’m telling you right now, he will do it again. Remember, President Trump may be the only president in modern times who has actually done everything he said he would do during his campaign. There’s this quote that I love from Ronald Reagan, where he said, “There isn’t any problem we can’t solve, if government will give us the facts, tell us what needs to be done, then get out of the way and let us have at it.” What that means to me, is as Americans, we work hard to overcome adversity and we face the tough times head-on.

Republican,4,Ann Dorin,8,53:51,"David is never, never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn’t know and just didn’t care. He would have done anything to help them. Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives. They only destroy them. President Trump understands this, has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help. We must heal before we can affect change. But, we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer. We need to come together in peace and remember that every life is precious. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 54:57 )  Good evening. I’m Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a public servant. Before I begin, I’d like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake family and the other families who’ve been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha. As Jacob’s mother has urged the country, let’s use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together, to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 55:37 )  In order to succeed and change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens. History reminds us that necessary change comes through hope and love, not senseless and destructive violence. Abraham Lincoln once said to an America divided that, “Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events.” Ja’Ron Smith: ( 56:22 )  These words of warning are relevant today. We have a choice. Do we want big government that controls our lives from cradle to grave? Or, do we believe in the power and wisdom of the people and their ability to self-govern, with help from a limited federal government? Our president, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he’s thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or towards enforces the media. He is real. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 57:07 )  Right now, we need real. We need courage. We can’t cower in a corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place. We must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 57:38 )  President Trump does not dabble in identity politics. He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, a rising tide lifts all boats. Many on the other side, love to incite division, by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong. Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for black people. In Palm beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 58:17 )  One of the first things he did as president, was bring the office of historically black colleges and universities into the White House, so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African- American unemployment was at an all time low. President Trump accomplished prison reform. He created incentives to encourage investors to become involved with economically deprived areas of America. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 58:47 )  He strongly supports school choice, fully recognizing that no matter what circumstances a person is born into, they can achieve success with a good education. It was true for me. When my mother forced me to read books about doctors, entrepreneurs, inventors, and scientists, I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you in life, is you. My mother always told me, “Ben, you can do anything. But, I will never allow you to become a victim.” It was then that I stopped listening to the people who were trying to convince me that I was a victim, and that others were responsible for my victimhood. Ja’Ron Smith: ( 59:36 )  What is racist, is the fact that African-Americans have the highest abortion rate. President Trump is the most pro-life president in the country’s history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak. The vision of a shining city upon a hill came from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount. America is that shiny city. We are the beacon of hope for the world. At this moment in time, President Donald Trump is the man with the courage, the vision, and the ability to keep it shining brightly.",851,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt

A one- year-old child shot dead in his stroller. Innocent people, innocent lives lost. One tragedy is too many, but every day the number keeps growing. Every day our communities are asking us, “Why is this happening?” Pat Lynch: ( 01:01:34 )  The answer is simple. The Democrats have walked away from us. They have walked away from police officers and they’ve walked away from the innocent people we protect. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and our institutions. The loudest voices have taken control and our so-called leaders are scrambling to catch up with them. In city after city, they’ve slashed police budgets.

I’ve never heard from so many cops from every corner of the country who are saying the same thing, “Our hands are tied.” Pat Lynch: ( 01:02:58 ) If we’re going to turn the tide and restore law and order, we cannot fall into the left’s trap. There is nobody who hates bad cops, more than good cops. But, that doesn’t matter to the radical left. To them, we’re all just bad because we’re all just blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn’t about a single incident. It isn’t the result of one bad law or one bad policy. It’s about a message. The message is, police officers are the enemy.

Tonight you’re probably at home while I stand alone. Stands alone, that was the motto of my old army unit, the 506 infantry, the original band of brothers. From the Normandy beaches to the Iraqi desert, we fought alongside each other, but we were always prepared to stand alone. And so it is with our nation, we lead the free world, but we’ll stand alone if we must, to defend America. Donald Trump understands this, he puts America first. That’s why America is safer now than four years ago. But Joe Biden would return us to a weak and dangerous past.

Joe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenge the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran’s terrorist mastermind, Qasim Solaimani. Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the Ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Joe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance.

President Trump stands up the China’s cheating and stealing and lying. Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our Southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealer for poisoning our kids. Joe said Chinese communist aren’t even our competitor, aren’t bad folks, just months before they unleashed this plague on the world. President Trump is clear eyed about the Chinese threat and he is making China pay. But China’s not giving up, in fact, they’re rooting for Joe Biden.

President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day we never heard from Joe Biden.

Another hostage was to smuggle out a letter Kayla had written. As we read it, we could see that God was holding her in his arms. In her words, she felt tenderly, cradled in freefall. She also wrote, “I have been shown in darkness light, and have learned that even in prison one can be free. I am grateful.

I was shocked to see people leave major challenges, unsolved, so they can blame the other side, campaign on the same issue in the next. But Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway Elites, Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, and one reason alone, to make America great again.

After the meeting, as I walked with my father back towards the residence, he said, “You know, the reason this has never been done before is because our leaders haven’t had the guts.

In president Trump’s first term, we secured the largest ever increase for childcare funding, giving more than 800,000 low income families great childcare at a cost they can afford. As part of Republican tax cuts, in 2019 alone, our child tax credit put over $2,000 into the pockets of 40 million American families.

Yet when I was fighting less than three years ago at the president’s direction to get Congress to double the child tax credit, not a single Democrat voted to pass the law. We got it done anyway.

Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people. Since the day he took the oath of office, I’ve watched my father take on the failed policies of the past and do what no leader has done before. Recently, he took dramatic action to cut the cost of prescription drugs, despite fielding angry calls from the CEOs of nearly every major pharmaceutical company. Now, when we see attack ads paid for by Big Pharma, my dad smiles and says to me, ” You know we’re doing something really right if they’re hitting us so hard.” Ivanka Trump: ( 01:48:06 )  This spring, our president saw that American crops were going to waste because food supply chains were disrupted by the virus. He directed Secretary Perdue and me to find a way to get this nutritious food, fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy to families most in need. Within a matter of days, we launched the Farmers to Family Food Box Program, which has now delivered over a hundred million meals into the hands of American families. To protect the most vulnerable among us, I’ve worked alongside the president as he signed into law nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking. I’ve stood by my father’s side at Dover Air Force Base as he’s received our fallen heroes, and each time it has steeled his resolve to finally stop, finally stop the endless foreign wars.",318,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Ivanka Trump,12,01:49:19,"To change the paradigm in the Middle East, he took a fresh approach. I heard foreign leaders beg him not to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, yet he delivered on a promise, also made anD unfulfilled by past presidents because my father knew that it was the right thing to do. Defying all expectations, just weeks ago, he rewrote history again by making a peace agreement in the Middle East, the biggest breakthrough in a quarter century. For the first time in a long time, we have a president who has called out Washington’s hypocrisy and they hate him for it. Dad, people attack you for being unconventional, but I love you for being real, and I respect you for being effective.",123,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Ivanka Trump,13,01:50:37,"Our president refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the big political elite. To my father, you are the elite. You are the only people he cares about scoring points with. If these problems were easy to solve, previous presidents would have done so, but you don’t achieve different results by doing things the same way. Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington. America doesn’t need another empty vessel who will do whatever the media and the fringe of his party demands. Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. Tonight, I could not be more proud to introduce my father, a man I know was made for this moment in history.

Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please, I stand before you tonight, honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years. We begin this evening. Our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago.

I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction and to all of my children, Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you.

In a new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.

This has been the home of larger than life figures like Teddy Roosevelt, and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like president Grant, and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the course of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody civil war, president Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God in his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.",159,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt

Republican,4,Donald Trump,16,02:02:59,"We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakeable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the Space Program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to dismantle and destroy it. It won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight I ask you a simple question; how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country.",316,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,17,02:06:18,"In the left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in almighty God. Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul, he is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden has spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended. Four years ago I ran for president because could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments, but at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg who heads NATO was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that president Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you. From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the Cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary, you’ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, ” America first.” Donald Trump: ( 02:11:08 )  Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and did the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured for the first time, American energy independence. We passed record setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people.

By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices.

Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building and a better location, real estate deal, right? Opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. Many things like that that government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to UAE, thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number one terrorist by far, Qasem Soleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2. 5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know.

As Vice President, he supported the transpacific partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out.

One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia.",108,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,38,02:41:40,"She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s Finest, who I was very, very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. Great, great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago, in the 4th of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shifts so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. We honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable.",225,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,39,02:43:38,"We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They’re afraid to lose their pension. They’re afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. Those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule.",112,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,40,02:44:37,"We can never allow mob rule. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat- run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call, we’re ready to go in. We’ll take care of your problem in a matter of hours, just call. We have to wait for the call. It’s too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.",128,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,41,02:45:35,"When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long.” As they looked at the statue, “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then, they said, “10 years in prison, I think that’s too long. Let’s go home.” During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they’re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in the water.",117,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,42,02:46:26,"It’s too late, Joe. In the face of left wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsenals, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired Police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protestors.",113,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,43,02:47:17,"They call them peaceful protestors. We’re honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members Brian and [inaudible 02:47:27]. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great man. Great man. As long as I am President, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.",131,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,44,02:48:39,"Last year, over 1,000 African Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands, more African Americans are victim, and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims, I never will. If the radical left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US Government. Just think of that. Liberal politicians claimed to be concerned about the strength of American institutions, but who exactly is attacking them.",128,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,45,02:49:43,"Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle descent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by radical left. Always remember, they’re coming after me because I am fighting for you. That’s what’s happening. It’s been going on from before I even got elected. Remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true, very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget. Thank you. Thank you very much. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from Liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage?",231,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,46,02:52:24,"These same Liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in Waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I’m here. What’s the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they’re not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world that is not a building, it’s a home as far as I’m concerned.",117,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,47,02:53:27,"It’s not even a house, it’s a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history, but it’s all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our resilience for bad things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We’re taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.",121,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,48,02:54:25,"We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. We will have strong borders. I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country.",79,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,49,02:55:02,"…borders, we don’t have a country, don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty and defend your 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your 2nd Amendment doesn’t have a chance, I can tell you that. I have totally protected it. We will protect Medicare and social security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums, they’re coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is, you haven’t seen that in a long time. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect, we will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in. They do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it’s amazing how open they’ve been lately. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars.",315,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,50,02:58:18,"This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision, than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a deprived nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by cancel culture, speech codes and soul crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots. We’re a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or in any way, reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.",166,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,51,02:59:51,"I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the Rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money, they didn’t have fame, but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure.",145,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,52,03:01:10,"Ranchers and miners, Cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers, they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns. And with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the sky scrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call from Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima. American Patriots raised into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American liberty.",182,www_rev_com_blog_transcripts2020-republican-national-convention-rnc-night-4-transcript.txt
Republican,4,Donald Trump,53,03:03:02,"They had no fear, but America didn’t stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stay until and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world, for America, there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together we are unstoppable, together we are unbeatable, because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very, very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.

The good people of Milwaukee and I were so excited when we learned that our resilient city was chosen to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention. It was the first time a major political party chose Wisconsin to hold its convention, but these are not conventional times and as a result, as we all know, this is not a conventional convention, and as much as we would have loved to host you in person, I am proud that the Democratic Party and the City of Milwaukee have made the health of our residents our number one priority. Unlike the president, we’ve never called COVID-19 a hoax, unlike the president, we’ve never made fun of face masks and unlike the president, we’ve never belittled our public health experts. We understand why we can’t be together this week and I hope you do to, and as our party comes together virtually to nominate Joe Biden to be our next president, we’re showing the country that we’re nominating a leader who isn’t afraid to make tough choices or to work with health experts, not against them, to address this pandemic.",210,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-2020-night-2-transcript.txt

My name is Maria Cardona and I am so honored to serve as co-chair of the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Convention along with my friend and colleague Congressman Barney Frank. The Rules Committee met the last week of July to adopt the convention rules of procedure, officers, and agenda. The committee approved the rules that will govern the convention. These rules are based on a longstanding process that has governed our conventions for many, many cycles. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 health crisis, these rules that were approved focus on providing for a convention that will transform the convention experience for delegates and for participants and will allow for maximum participation by those delegates.",122,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-2020-night-2-transcript.txt

The Rules Committee also took action on a resolution that was recommended for approval by convention delegates. The resolution calls on the Democratic National Committee to continue the work from this cycle to improve our nominating process and to build on those reforms for the 2024 cycle. The resolution calls on the DNC Rules Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the presidential nominating reforms that were made and to evaluate where even further reforms might by needed.

Democratic,2,Barney Frank,1,13:02,"Two things about the rules are very important to note. One, they continue and build on the trend towards making our nominating process as democratic as possible with a small d.

Secondly it’s important to note that everything in these rules is the product of a very free agreement between the Sanders and Biden people as it was last time between Clinton and Sanders, that is we have a very democratic set of rules agreed upon enthusiastically by both camps.",101,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-2020-night-2-transcript.txt

Leaders who respond to the needs of hardworking Americans who right this minute are unable to pay rent, put food on the table and keep their loved ones safe. As a black woman, I find myself at a crucial intersection in American politics. For far too long, black female leadership in this country has been utilized without being acknowledged or valued, but we are turning the tide. Hello Kamala.

He will restore America’s leadership in the world and restore the alliances we need to address the dangers that threaten our nation, from climate change to nuclear proliferation. Today, we are a country divided, and we have a president doing everything in his power to make it that way, and keep us that way. What a difference it will make to have a president who unites us, who restores our strength, and our soul.

You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways. There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors. The rooms are dark as the bright young faces that should fill them are now confined to boxes on a computer screen. I hear it from so many of you, the frustration of parents juggling work while they support their children’s learning are afraid that their kids might get sick from school. The concern of every person working without enough protection, the despair in the lines that stretch out before food banks, and the indescribable sorrow that follows every lonely last breath when the ventilators turn off.

But I’ve always understood why he did it, for the daughter who convinces her mom to finally get a breast cancer screening and misses work to drive her to the clinic, for the community college student who has faced homelessness and survived abuse, but binds the grit to finish her degree and make a good life for her kids. For the little boy whose mom is serving as a Marine in Iraq, who puts on a brave face in his video call and doesn’t complain when the only thing he wants for his birthday is to be with her. For all those people, Joe gives his personal phone number to, at rope lines and events. The ones he talks to for hours after dinner, helping them smile through their loss, letting them know that they aren’t alone. He does it for you.

Yes, so many classrooms are quiet right now, the playgrounds are still. But if you listen closely, you can hear the sparks of change in the air across this country. Educators, parents, first responders, Americans of all walks of life are putting their shoulders back, fighting for each other. We haven’t given up.

You can see why she’s the love of my life and the rock of our family. She never gives herself much credit, but the truth is she’s the strongest person I know. She’s a backbone like a ramrod. She loves fiercely, cares deeply. Nothing stops her when she sets her mind to getting something right.

We had hoped to gather in place, but instead we figured out a safe and responsible way to come together to share ideas and talk abut the future of our country. That’s the kind of leadership we need right now. That’s the kind of leadership that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will bring to the White House. So during the next four nights, we will gather safely from our homes to listen, to learn, to be inspired to act, to vote and to build that more perfect union.

Democratic,1,Eva Longoria,2,05:58,"I’m here tonight as a ninth generation Texan, as a daughter of a veteran and a teacher, as a mother, as a voter and as a patriot. I share Joe Biden’s belief that the story of America is one of ordinary people coming together to do extraordinary things, and at our best our country [inaudible 00:06:18]. Tonight, we’re going to begin with the simple kindness we’ve been extending to each other a lot lately. We’re going to check in with folks around the country and ask, “How are you doing?” As many of you know, small businesses employ half of all U.S. workers. Tonight, we have Scott. Scott, you are a small business owner from Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Small businesses have been hit so hard in this crisis, so many small businesses. How are you doing? How are you managing.",139,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Scott Richardson,1,06:53,"Well, it’s been rough. Rough is a nice word to say it. My wife and I, 31 years ago, began our business and quite honestly, over all these years, we’ve faced some adversity and challenges, but to be honest with you, nothing like we are today. We’ve literally had to reinvent our business several times since the beginning of the year, just to stay afloat. Our revenue, for example, is off about 40%. We have half of the employees that we had pre-COVID and our customers are a little scared, our employees are sometimes afraid to come to work because of the COVID. To be honest with you, I’m just frustrated. I don’t understand how we got here. We are the greatest nation in the world. It just seems to me that maybe if we just came together on this one issue alone, maybe as Americans and being united, we can overcome?",152,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Eva Longoria,3,08:17,"Yeah. Thank you, Scott, for sharing your story. I’m sure many small business owners feel the same way that you’re feeling now. We wish you the best for your business and, of course, for your family. Now I’d like to turn to Marley Diaz, who is 15 years old from West Orange, New Jersey.

Democratic,1,Marley Dias,2,08:59,"So I started doing virtual read alouds online, which has been so fun, getting to interact and meet new kids and encourage and promote the joy that we can find in reading and in learning. It’s also super fun to see teenagers like me going on social media and talking about social issues and injustices that they care about because sometimes you don’t have that space in school. So I hope that a year from now, when we get to go back and be safe and be protected, we will still have these conversations and still have a new possibility and a new world.",104,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

I don’t think I was doing half of what you’re doing at 15 and I love seeing how brave and creative your generation is to creating change. So thank you. Thank you so much for your work.

Democratic,1,Rick Telesz,1,09:59,"Well, first of all, I’d like to offer the Trump family our condolences for his loss. Getting back to the business side of it, the trade war was … it was a real stressful and truly a devastating effect on the farm. Most probably what people can relate to mostly in agriculture is the soybean [inaudible 00:10:19], and then whenever you compound the effects of the COVID-19 virus, nobody could have prevented that. It’s a shame our leadership misinforms people like myself in the country on what was coming down the road. My biggest concern is that if these trends continue with this type of leadership, I will be the last generation farming this farm?",115,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Democratic,1,Michelle Beebe,1,11:27,"Hi Eva. Well, we’ve already started school, but it is a little challenging because every day something seems to change. We start one way one day and we have to change it the next day. I know that right now it’s kind of sad not to see the kiddos when we’re back, but I know that that will change. We’re going to have to adapt and persevere. But honestly, right now, all I can think about is keeping my kiddo safe. I know back in March, we had them at home and we were doing okay, but now they’re wanting us to them back to school and it’s a little scary with all the uprise and COVID cases?",118,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

I think there’s nothing more difficult for us as moms than to see our children suffer, and so I think you’re doing a great job of guiding them through this very difficult time, and thank you for the work you do as a nurse. It’s truly heroic. I really enjoy talking to all of you. I think I have one last question. Do you believe that change is coming?

Democratic,1,Joe Biden,1,13:05,"… in 1776, the declaration of independence. We hold these truths to be self evident. These words are the basis for the American creed, equality, equity, fairness, decency. America didn’t live up to that promise for most of the people at the time, the people of color, for women, but we were born of an idea that every single solitary person given half a chance, no matter where they’re from, given half a chance, there’s not a single thing they cannot do if they work at it.

Oh, I sure wish you all were here in the city of Milwaukee, which takes its name from the languages of the first peoples interpreted as good land and gathering place by the waters. This is a city where blood was shed for labor rights, where a fugitive slave was freed from prison, where women’s right to vote was first ratified. But today, we gather virtually however. We gather unified in spirit, unified in our values and purpose to heal divisions and together move the nation confidently into a prosperous inclusive future.",113,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Democratic,1,Derrick Johnson,1,18:38,"The idea of us calling ourselves the United States of America feels like it’s pretty wrong right now. Fairly ashamed to say it, but I’m one of many who voted for the current president, Donald Trump. I challenge you to think back to what made you vote for Donald Trump in 2016. I know I sure have. I’ve registered as a Democrat for the first time in my life. I’m doing that because I think this election is bigger than any political party. What I think in light of current events, if nothing else, we need more than anything is a proven leader. Donald Trump’s rhetoric is … it’s divisive, it’s dangerous. It’s also really difficult to vote for someone who essentially has zero platform right now, four months out from the election. Joe Biden on the other hand has a very detailed plan, things like unity, education, climate preservation, racial inequality, and even healthcare. We have a chance right now to look ourselves in the mirror and go vote for a proven leader with a history of caring about others and truly putting all Americans first.",187,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

We’re going to talk about how to make it right.

Please welcome Mayor Muriel Bowser.",98,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Muriel Bowser,1,21:00,"Hello, I’m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington, DC. The story of our nation’s capital is a story of reckoning. It was here that John Lewis and Dr. King spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. It was here that millions of women and men flooded the streets for the women’s march. It was here that, just weeks ago, Americans donned face masks and safely and peacefully protested the death of George Floyd. But while we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting. He stood in front of one of our most treasured houses of worship and held a Bible for a photo op. He sent troops in camouflage into our streets. He sent tear gas into the air and federal helicopters too.",123,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Muriel Bowser,2,21:42,"I knew if he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town, and that’s when I said enough. I said enough for every black and brown American who has experienced injustice, enough for every American who believes in justice. But I said enough for another reason too. I have a two year old daughter and I want her to grow up in an America where she’s not scared to walk to the store, an America where she’s safe behind the doors of her own home, an America where the president doesn’t fan the flames of racism and looks out for all of us.",109,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Muriel Bowser,3,22:15,"So I created Black Lives Matter Plaza right behind me as the place where we could come together to say enough. And by coming together this November to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will say next, because we can’t just paint those words behind me. We can’t just say those words. We have to live those words. We have to undo the laws and systems that have codified racism for far too long. But we have to do something too. Each and every one of us, challenge our own biases.

Brianna Taylor should be alive today. Ahmaud Arbery should be alive today. Eric Garner should be alive today. Stefan Clark, Tatiana Jefferson, Sandra Bland. They should all be alive today. So it’s up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions will be their legacies. We must always find ourselves in what John Lewis called good trouble for the names we do not know, the faces we’ll never see, those who can’t mourn because their murders didn’t go viral.

It’s a path that’s led to division, dysfunction, irresponsibility, and growing vitriol between our citizens. Continuing to follow that path will have terrible consequences for America’s soul because we’re being taken down the wrong road by a president who has pitted one against the other.

Yes, there are areas where Joe and I absolutely disagree, but that’s okay because that’s America. Because whatever our differences, we respect one another as human beings, each of us searching for justice and for purpose. We can all see what’s going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or a party has all the answers. But what we do know is that we can do better than what we’ve been seeing today, for sure. And I know that Joe Biden with his experience and his wisdom and his decency, can bring us together to help us find that better way. I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp, left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that because I know the measure of the man. He’s reasonable, faithful, respectful, and no one pushes Joe around. Joe Biden is a man for our times, times that call for all of us to take off our partisan hats and put our nation first for ourselves, and of course for our children.

We’re facing the worst public health crisis in a hundred years, and the worst economic collapse since the great depression. We are confronting systemic racism and the enormous threat to our planet of climate change. And in the midst of all of this, we have a president who is not only incapable of addressing these crises, but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism. This election is the most important in the modern history of this country. In response to the unprecedented crises we face, we need an unprecedented response, a movement like never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight for democracy and decency, and against greed, oligarchy, and bigotry. And we need Joe Biden as our next president. Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions of people who supported my campaign this year and in 2016.",160,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Senator Bernie Sanders,2,01:34:19,"My friends, thank you for your trust, your support, and the love you show Jane, me, and our family. Together we have moved this country in a bold new direction, showing that all of us, black and white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, yearn for a nation based on the principles of justice, love, and compassion. Our campaign ended several months ago, but our movement continues and is getting stronger every day. Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical on now mainstream. But let us be clear if Donald Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy. At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy. During this president’s term, the unthinkable has become normal. He has tried to prevent people from voting, undermined the US Postal Service, deployed the military and federal agents against peaceful protestors, threatened to delay the election, and suggested that he will not leave office if he loses.",176,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

I and my family and many of yours, know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency, and humanity. As long as I am here, I will work with Progressive’s, with Moderates, and yes, with Conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat. This president is not just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science, he has put our lives and health in jeopardy. Trump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic, while refusing to take strong action, to produce the masks, gowns, and gloves our healthcare workers desperately need. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs.

Since this pandemic began, over 30 million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. Millions of working families are wondering how they will feed their kids, and they’re worried that they will be evicted from their homes. And how has Trump responded? Instead of maintaining the $600 a week unemployment supplement that workers were receiving, and the $1,200 emergency checks that many of you received… Instead of helping small businesses, Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually nothing to address the crisis, while threatening the very future of Social Security and Medicare.",110,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Together, we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate, and more inclusive. I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. Let me offer you just a few examples of how Joe will move us forward. Joe supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Joe will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years. These initiatives will create millions of good paying jobs all across our country. As you know, we are the only industrialized nation not to guarantee healthcare for all people.

Well, a presidential election can reveal who we are too, and four years ago too many people chose to believe that their votes didn’t matter. Maybe they were fed up. Maybe they thought the outcome wouldn’t be close. Maybe the barriers felt too steep.

Our leaders had worked hand in hand with scientists to help prevent an Ebola outbreak from becoming a global pandemic. Four years later, the state of this nation is very different. More than 150,000 people have died, and our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long. It has left millions of people jobless.

If we see someone suffering or struggling, we don’t stand in judgment. We reach out. Because there but for the grace of God go I. It is not a hard concept to grasp. It’s what we teach our children.

We degrade ourselves. We degrade the very causes for which we fight. But let’s be clear going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty. Going high means taking the harder path. It means scraping and clawing our way to that mountaintop. Going high means standing fierce against hatred while we’re remembering that we are one nation under God, and if we want to survive, we’ve got to find a way to live together and work together across our differences.

Now I understand that my message won’t be heard by some people. We live in a nation that is deeply divided, and I am a black woman speaking at the Democratic convention. But enough of you know me by now, you know that I tell you exactly what I’m feeling. You know I hate politics.",121,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Michelle Obama,12,01:54:16,"But you also know that I care about this nation. You know how much I care about all of our children. So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this. If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don’t make a change in this election. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.",81,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Michelle Obama,13,01:54:50,"I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith. He was a terrific vice president. He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country. He listens. He will tell the truth and trust science. He will make smart plans and manage a good team. He will govern as someone who’s lived a life that the rest of us can recognize. When he was a kid, Joe’s father lost his job. When he was a young senator, Joe lost his wife and his baby daughter, and when he was vice president, he lost his beloved son. So Joe knows the anguish of sitting at a table with an empty chair, which is why he gives his time so freely to grieving parents. Joe knows what it’s like to struggle, which is why he gives his personal phone number to kids overcoming a stutter of their own. His life is a testament to getting back up, and he is going to channel that same grit and passion to pick us all up, to help us heal and guide us forward.",189,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Michelle Obama,14,01:56:11,"Now, Joe is not perfect, and he’d be the first to tell you that. But there is no perfect candidate, no perfect president, and his ability to learn and grow, we find in that the kind of humility and maturity that so many of us yearn for right now. Because Joe Biden has served this nation his entire life without ever losing sight of who he is. But more than that, he has never lost sight of who we are, all of us. Joe Biden wants all of our kids to go to a good school, see a doctor when they’re sick, live on a healthy planet. He’s got plans to make all of that happen.",116,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

He wants all of our kids to be able to go to a movie or a math class without being afraid of getting shot. He wants all our kids to grow up with leaders who won’t just serve themselves and their wealthy peers, but will provide a safety net for people facing hard times. If we want a chance to pursue any of these goals, any of these most basic requirements for a functioning society, we have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored.",118,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt
Democratic,1,Michelle Obama,16,01:57:52,"Because right now, folks who know they cannot win fair and square at the ballot box are doing everything they can to stop us from voting. They’re closing down polling places in minority neighborhoods. They’re purging voter rolls. They’re sending people out to intimidate voters, and they’re lying about the security of our ballots. These tactics are not new, but this is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning. We have got to vote like we did in 2008 and 2012. We’ve got to show up with the same level of passion and hope for Joe Biden. We’ve got to vote early, in person if we can. We’ve got to request our mail in ballots right now, tonight, and send them back immediately, and follow up to make sure they’re received, and then make sure our friends and families do the same. We have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner, and maybe breakfast too, because we’ve got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.",192,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-1-transcript.txt

Even when you’re exhausted, you’re mustering up unimaginable courage to put on those scrubs and give our loved ones a fighting chance. Even when you’re anxious, you’re delivering those packages, stocking those shelves and doing all that essential work so that all of us can keep moving forward. Even when it all feels so overwhelming. Working are somehow piecing it all together without childcare. Teachers are getting creative so that our kids can still learn and grow. Our young people are desperately fighting to pursue their dreams. When the horrors of systemic racism shook our country and our consciousness, millions of Americans of every age, every background rose up to march for each other, crying out for justice and progress.

So it is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history, echoing heroes, like John Lewis, who said, “When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.” That is the truest form of empathy. Not just feeling but doing, not just for ourselves or our kids, but for everyone, for all our kids. If we want to keep the possibility of progress alive in our time, if we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history, and we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States.

Democratic,3,Speaker 1,2,21:36,"… Joe Biden. We also reaffirmed our values as a party, the party of resilience and hope, empathy and inclusion. This is the party that fired me up as a young man in the ’60s registering voters with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the Mississippi Delta and campaigning for Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer for the United States House of Representatives. It’s the party that taught me that public servants should serve the public even when your opponents call you names like nasty or slow. And today, it’s the party that calls us to stand up for what’s right, and to get in good trouble. So on behalf of this great party, it’s my pleasure to welcome once again, delegates, alternates, standing committee members, friends, and fellow Americans, members of the media and guests from around the world. I now call this third session of the 48th Quadrennial National Convention of the Democratic Party to order.

We were really looking forward to having you here in America’s Dairyland. Unfortunately, the pandemic means we can’t do that this year. But what unites us is far, far greater than what divides us. So even though we can’t be with each other, I know we have a shared sense of purpose, that is to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This November is about returning kindness, respect, empathy, and civility back to the White House, and that’s who Joe and Kamala are, because they know, especially during challenging times like these, the problems we face can only be solved by all of us together.

I know many of you plan to vote this year, but amidst the excitement and enthusiasm for this election, you’ve also heard about obstacles and misinformation and folks making it harder for you to cast your ballot. So I think we need to ask ourselves, why don’t they want us to vote? Why is there so much effort to silence our voices? And the answer is because when we vote, things change. When we vote, things get better. When we vote, we address the need for all people to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. So each of us needs a plan, a voting plan. Joe and I want to make sure you’re prepared. If you text, vote, to 30330, we’ll help you come up with your plan and remember deadlines and get ready to vote in your community.",164,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt

Democratic,3,Kerry Washington,1,27:33,"Welcome to night three of the Democratic National Convention. I’m honored to be joining you as we continue to celebrate this unconventional convention. We’re going to be hearing a lot more from Senator Harris later, I promise. But first, when I was in seventh or eighth grade, we memorized the preamble of the constitution and I’ve never forgotten it. The first 15 words of our constitution are, we the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, we say, more perfect, because our union is not without flaws. When our constitution was written, women couldn’t vote, black people were considered three fifths of a human being, but there in lies the work. No one is perfect, nothing is, but it is the striving toward justice, equality and truth that distinguishes us. We fight for a more perfect union because we are fighting for the soul of this country and for our lives.",157,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt

Tonight, we are going to hear from so many phenomenal women who are working to help us build that more perfect union; Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. We’re going to see an incredible performance from Jennifer Hudson and a world premier performance from Billie Eilish. We’ll meet so many of the activists and organizers working to build a more equal, more just future. And we’re going to hear from our 44th president, Barack Obama. That’s a long way of saying this is going to be an unforgettable night filled with important voices. But the most important voice we hope to hear from tonight is the one we need to hear from most, it’s yours. Because if we are going to repair the damage that has been done, if we are going to finally realize the dream, we the people have to get involved.",158,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kerry Washington,3,29:45,"Each and every one of us is the we. You are the we. It’s going to be your voice, your service, your action that helps us create that more perfect union. Tonight, we’re going to talk about where we are and where we’re going on so many issues important to our future. 90% of Americans support common sense gun laws, because we need to do more to address the epidemic of gun violence. Let’s start there. Emma G.: ( 30:23 )  People affected by everyday gun violence have to walk by the street corner where their best friend, their brother, their mother, their nephew, where they themselves were shot, and life goes on and on as if we all haven’t just watched a loved one die and get put in the grave. The whole point of what I’m saying here is until one of us or all of us stand up and say, I can’t do this anymore, I can’t sit by and watch the news treat these shootings like acts of God, gun violence isn’t just going to stop until there’s a force fighting harder against it, and I’m going to do something to prevent it. They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call… Audience: ( 31:11 )  BS. Emma G.: ( 31:15 )  They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call… Audience: ( 31:18 )  BS. Emma G.: ( 31:21 )  They say guns are just tools like knives. We call… Audience: ( 31:24 )  BS. Emma G.: ( 31:27 )  They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call… Audience: ( 31:33 )  BS. Emma G.: ( 31:37 )  That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about. That we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call… Audience: ( 31:43 )  BS. Emma G.: ( 31:48 )  Well, what we’re fighting for will happen because we’re fighting so strongly for it. We’re going to make this change. Maria W.: ( 32:02 )  Long before this pandemic, our country has been suffering from the epidemic of gun violence. Shenee J.: ( 32:07 )  Gun violence is a public health crises. One that disproportionately affects the black and brown communities. First, it was my beloved fiance. Maria W.: ( 32:17 )  My son, Jerry, at the Pulse shooting in Orlando. Shenee J.: ( 32:21 )  Seven years later, it would be my son. Maria W.: ( 32:24 )  I know exactly the pain, the toll, heartbreak of gun violence. Lylena E.: ( 32:30 )  My freshman year, my high school went into lockdown because a kid brought a gun to school. Joseph M.: ( 32:35 )  We’ve had to endure live shooter training drills in our schools. Lylena E.: ( 32:38 )  High schoolers have enough to deal with. They shouldn’t also be responsible for keeping themselves safe at school. That’s the job of the government. Joseph M.: ( 32:46 )  We have to end corporate lobbying by the NRA. We have to invest in mental health in our communities rather than making our schools maximum security prisons. Shenee J.: ( 32:54 )  I want a president who will make gun violence prevention a top priority, and I believe Joe Biden is that person.",564,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt

And when millions of families lost their homes my friend from California, Senator Kamala Harris took on the big banks and won.

Democratic,3,Speaker 41,1,01:49:47,"Vice-president Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a career of public service spanning nearly half a century Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has left his mark on almost every part of our nation. Fighting for a stronger middle class, a fair judicial system and a smarter foreign policy. Providing unyielding support for our troops, combating crime and violence against women, leading our quest to cure cancer and safeguarding the landmark American recovery and Reinvestment Act from corruption. With his charm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism, Joe Biden has garnered the respect and esteem of colleagues of both parties and the friendship of people across the nation and around the world while summoning the strength, faith and grace to overcome great personal tragedy.",125,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Speaker 41,2,01:50:41,"This son of Scranton, Claymont and Wilmington has become one of the most consequential vice- presidents in American history.

Biden Jr. for his lifetime of service on behalf of the United States of America.",56,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,6,01:51:33,"Good evening everybody, as you’ve seen by now, this isn’t a normal convention. It’s not a normal time. So tonight I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election, because what we do these next 76 days will echo through generations to come. I’m in Philadelphia, where our constitution was drafted and signed, and it wasn’t a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery and failed to guarantee women and even men who didn’t own property, the right to participate in the political process. But embedded in this document was a north star that would guide future generations. A system of representative government, a democracy through which we could better realize our highest ideals. Through civil war and bitter struggles, we improved this constitution to include the voices of those who’d once been left out and gradually we made this country more just and more equal and more free.",157,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,7,01:52:53,"The one constitutional office elected by all of the people is the presidency. So at a minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us, regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have or who we voted for. But we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for and died for.",112,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,8,01:53:46,"I have sat in The Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did help for the sake of our country that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care, but he never did. For close to four years now he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t and the consequences of that failure are severe.",162,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,9,01:54:58,"170, 000 Americans dead, millions of jobs gone. Well, those are the top taken more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. Now I know that in times as polarized as these, most of you have already made up your mind, but maybe you’re still not sure which candidate you’ll vote for or whether you’ll vote at all. Maybe you’re tired of the direction we’re headed, but you can’t see a better path yet or you just don’t know enough about the person who wants to lead us there.",104,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,10,01:55:54,"So let me tell you about my friend Joe Biden. 12 years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I didn’t know I’d ended up finding a brother. Joe and I come from different places, different generations, but what I quickly came to admire about Joe Biden is his resilience, born of too much struggle. His empathy, born a too much grief. Joe is a man who learned early on to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity. Living by the words his parents taught him. No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.",102,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,11,01:56:42,"That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts, that’s who Joe is. When he talks with someone who’s lost her job, Joe remembers the night his father sat him down to say that he’d lost his. When Joe listens to a parent who’s trying to hold it all together right now, he does it as a single dad who took the train back to Wilmington each and every night so he could take his kids into bed. When he meets with military families who’ve lost bear hero, he does it as a kindred spirit. The parent of an American soldier. Somebody whose faith has endured the hardest loss there is. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country.",148,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,12,01:57:48,"And in my friend Kamala Harris, he’s chosen ideal partner who is more than prepared for the job. Someone who knows what it’s like to overcome barriers and who’s made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream. Along with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality. They will get this pandemic under control like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They’ll expand healthcare to more Americans like Joe and I did 10 years ago when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law.",127,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,13,01:58:41,"They’ll rescue the economy like Joe helped me do after the great recession. I asked him to manage the Recovery Act, which jump-started the longest stretch of job growth in history. And he sees this moment now, not as a chance to get back to where we were, but to make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody. Whether it’s the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own or the shift worker, always on the edge of getting laid off or the student figuring out how to pay for next semester’s classes. Joe and Kamala will restore our standing in the world. And as we’ve learned from this pandemic that matters.",121,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,14,01:59:26,"Joe knows the world and the world knows him. He knows that our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow, a nation that stands with democracy, not dictators. A nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism, poverty, and disease. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American and that they care deeply about this democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder.",110,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,15,02:00:26,"They believe that no one, including the president is above the law and that no public official, including the president should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters. They understand that in this democracy, the commander-in- chief does not use the men and women of our military who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation as political props, to deploy against peaceful protestors on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren’t American, just because they disagree with you, a free press isn’t the enemy but the way we hold officials accountable. That our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic, depend on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.",126,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,16,02:01:29,"None of this should be controversial. These shouldn’t be Republican principles or Democratic principles, they are American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him have shown they don’t believe in these things. Tonight, I’m asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. But here’s the thing, no single American can fix this country alone. Not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional. You give me your vote, I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry.",101,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,17,02:02:22,"So I’m also asking you to believe in your own ability to embrace your own responsibility as citizens, to make sure that the basic tenants of our democracy endure because that’s what’s at stake right now, our democracy. Look, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know it. I understand why a white factory worker who’s seen his wages cut whereas jobs shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him and why a black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all.",123,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,18,02:03:18,"I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there’s still a place for him here. Why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and conspiracy theories, and think, “What is the point?” Well, here’s the point, this president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can’t win you over with their policies. So they’re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote does not matter. That is how they win. That is how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life and the lives of the people you love. That’s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well connected. How our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.",162,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,19,02:04:28,"That’s how a democracy withers until it’s no democracy at all. And we cannot let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you are going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this. All those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice. Last month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis, and some years ago, I sat down with John and a few remaining leaders of the early civil rights movement.",135,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Barack Obama,20,02:05:33,"One of them told me he never imagined he’d walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson. And then he told me that he had it up and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South. What we do echoes through generations, whatever our backgrounds. We are all the children of Americans who fought the good fight, great grandparents working in fire trips and sweatshops without rights or representation, farmers losing their dreams to dust, Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told, “Go back where you come from.” Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs made to feel suspect for the way they worshiped.

They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the middle, and yet instead of giving up, they joined together and they said, “Somehow, some way we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words in our founding documents to life.” I have seen that same spirit rising these past few years, folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn’t be separated, so that another classroom wouldn’t get shot up, so that our kids won’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet.",138,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt

So that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better, in so many ways you are this country’s dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, it’s a given, a conviction and what I want you to know is that for all its messiness and frustrations, your system of self government can be harnessed to help you realize those convictions for all of us.",120,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt

You’re the missing ingredient, the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creep. That work will continue long after this election, but any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days and by voting like never before for Joe and Kamala and candidates up and down the ticket so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for today and for all our days to come.

And at every step of the way I’ve been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom. Kamala Harris for the people. I have fought for children and survivors of sexual assault, I fought against transnational criminal organizations. I took on the biggest banks and help take down one of the biggest for- profit colleges. I know a predator when I see one. My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning, and oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words.",164,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,12,02:23:07,"I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America. I do so committed to the values she taught me, to the word that teaches me to walk by faith and not by sight, and to a vision passed on through generations of Americans one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a beloved community, where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, no matter where we come from or who we love. A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are United by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity, and respect.",113,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,13,02:24:10,"A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges and celebrate our triumphs together. Today, that country feels distant, Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods. If you’re a parent struggling with your child’s remote learning, or you’re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know what we’re doing right now is not working.",73,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,14,02:24:54,"And we are a nation that is grieving, grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy, and yes, the loss of certainty. And while this virus touches us all, we got to be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender, black, Latino, and indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.",60,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,15,02:25:32,"And this is not a coincidence, it is the effect of structural racism of inequities in education and technology, healthcare and housing, job security and transportation, the injustice in reproductive and maternal health care, in the excessive use of force by police and in our broader criminal justice system. This virus, it has no eyes and yet it knows exactly how we see each other and how we treat each other.",71,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,16,02:26:12,"And let’s be clear, there is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work for George Floyd, for Brianna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name, for our children and for all of us. We’ve got to do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because here’s the thing, none of us are free until all of us are free.",70,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,17,02:26:53,"So we’re at an inflection point, the constant chaos leaves us a drift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It’s a lot. And here’s the thing, we can do better and deserve so much more. We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work.",58,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,18,02:27:31,"A president who will bring all of us together, black, white, Latino, Asian, indigenous to achieve the future we collectively want. We must elect Joe Biden. And I will tell you, I knew Joe as vice president, I knew Joe on the campaign trail, and I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend. So Joe’s son Beau and I served as attorneys general of our states Delaware and California. During the great recession, he and I spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people’s homes.",106,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,19,02:28:25,"And Beau and I, we would talk about his family. How as a single father, Joe would spend four hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad, they went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice, reading bedtime stories. And while they endured and unspeakable loss, those two little boys always knew that they were deeply unconditionally loved.",78,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,20,02:29:03,"And what also moved me about Joe is the work that he did as he was going back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban. Who as vice president implemented the Recovery Act, which brought our country back from the great recessions. He championed the Affordable Care Act protecting millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world.",78,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,21,02:29:41,"Joe, he believes we stand with our allies and stand up to our adversaries. Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons.

Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn’t leave anyone behind, where a good paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.",63,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,22,02:30:20,"Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one. Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations. Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community. One that is strong and decent, just and kind, one in which we can all see ourselves.

Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,23,02:31:04,"The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise for all its complexities and imperfections, a promise worth fighting for.

Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,25,02:32:08,"We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic.

Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,26,02:32:39,"There’s something happening all across our country, it’s not about Joe or me, it’s about you and it’s about us, people of all ages and colors and creeds who are yes, taken to the streets and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors and getting out the vote.",52,www_rev_com_blog_transcriptsdemocratic-national-convention-dnc-night-3-transcript.txt
Democratic,3,Kamala Harris,27,02:33:09,"And we have shown that when we vote, we expand access to healthcare and expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.

And years from now, this moment will have passed and our children, and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re going to ask us, ” Where were you when the stakes were so high?” They will ask us, “What was it like?” And we will tell them, we will tell them not just how we felt, we will tell them what we did.

Democratic,3,Barack Obama,24,02:43:49,"But here’s the thing, no single American can fix this country alone, not even a president.
